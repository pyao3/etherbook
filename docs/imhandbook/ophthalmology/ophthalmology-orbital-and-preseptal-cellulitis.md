# Orbital vs Preseptal Cellulitis

Jonathan A. Barnett

---

## Background

- The septum is a fibrous, membranous structure that divides the
    anterior from the posterior orbit.

- Preseptal cellulitis = infection is bound anterior to the septum

- Orbital cellulitis (AKA postseptal cellulitis) = infection extends
    posterior to the septum

- Common risk factors/etiologies: URI, acute or chronic sinusitis,
    trauma, tooth abscess, stye or other local/adjacent skin
    infection/condition, local/adjacent bug bite, immunocompromised
    state, underlying systemic infection

- Often bacterial cause (gram positive Staph or Strep species, and/or
    gram negative anaerobic species like Peptococcus or Bacteroides).
    Consider fungal infection (Aspergillus, Mucor) in immunocompromised
    or diabetic patients.

## Evaluation

- Vital signs

- Labs: CBC, CMP, ESR, CRP, blood cultures, wound culture if any open
    draining areas

- Imaging: CT orbits with and without contrast

- Daily or BID photographs to track progression

- You can use the LRINEC scale to help assess whether the infection is
    necrotizing:

- https://www.mdcalc.com/lrinec-score-necrotizing-soft-tissue-infection.
    Necrotizing soft tissue infections should be addressed immediately
    and undergo surgical debridement ASAP.

## Management

- Preseptal cellulitis can usually be managed on an outpatient basis
    with PO antibiotics (e.g. augmentin) with close followup.

- However, if condition is worsening, if there is failure to improve
    on PO antibiotics, or if concerned for postseptal extension (i.e.,
    that the preseptal cellulitis has evolved into an orbital
    cellulitis), management generally includes:

    - IV broad spectrum antibiotics (usually Unasyn + Vancomycin to start
        if no intracranial extension; could also do Vancomycin +
        Ceftriaxone + Flagyl)

    - Ophthalmology Consult

    - Consider ID consult

    - Consider ENT consult if concomitant sinus disease (most of the time
        there is)

    - Consider OMFS consult if suspect etiology is odontogenic

    - Tobradex eye drops QID to affected eye

    - Nasal toilet (afrin, flonase, nasal saline)--usually dictated by ENT

    - Warm compresses at least QID to affected eye

    - Trend daily CRP

- If there is failure to improve on the above regimen, a large orbital
        abscess, optic nerve stretch on CT scan, evidence of necrotizing
        infection, or visual compromise, the patient may need to undergo
        surgical drainage.
