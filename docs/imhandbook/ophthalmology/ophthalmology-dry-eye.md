# Dry Eye

Jonathan A. Barnett

---

## Background

- Most common ocular complaint, especially amongst patients admitted
    to the hospital!
- Due to insufficient tear production and/or imbalance in the
    components that make up the tear film
- Etiology is vast and can include aging, eye strain/overuse, contact
    lens use, systemic and topical medications, post eye surgery,
    nutritional deficiencies, autoimmune disease, or concomitant with
    other ocular conditions.

## Presentation

- Blurry vision bilaterally that comes and goes (very commonâ€“if the
    patient complains of fluctuating blurriness, Dry Eye should be at
    the top of your differential!)
- Excessive tearing/watery eyes
- Stinging, burning, soreness, discomfort, gritty/foreign body
    sensation
- Discomfort with eye movements
- Trace/mild conjunctival injection

## Evaluation and Management

- If a patient's symptoms sound like Dry Eye, order some
    preservative-free (PF) artificial tears at least 4x/day and
    lubricating eye ointment at bedtime to see if the patient's symptoms
    improve.
- Polyvinyl alcohol-povidone PF (Refresh Classic)
- Lubricating ophthalmic ointment (Lubrifresh)
- Order them SCHEDULED. Do not order these eye drops PRN (patients
    will not ask for them).
- If a patient's symptoms fail to improve or worsen on artificial
    tears, consider paging ophthalmology for additional assistance. If
    there is no apparent imminent threat to vision, you can place an
    ophthalmology outpatient referral upon discharge.
