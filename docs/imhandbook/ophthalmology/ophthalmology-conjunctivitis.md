## Background and Presentation

- Allergic, viral, or bacterial cause

- All forms present with red and irritated conjunctiva

- In practice it can be difficult to distinguish between the types of
    conjunctivitis. However, these are rough guidelines:

    - Allergic: hx of allergies/atopy, bilateral, chemosis, watery/mucoid
        discharge, itchiness predominant symptom

    - Viral: hx of recent URI or exposure, unilateral first then
        bilateral, itchy/burning, subconjunctival hemorrhages or petechiae,
        watery/mucoid discharge, tender preauricular lymph nodes

    - Bacterial: itching less prominent, burning/aching/stabbing
        discomfort predominates, unilateral first then bilateral,
        mucoid/purulent discharge (and more copious)

- Blurry vision is common, but loss of vision should not occur if
    disease limited to conjunctiva.

## Management:

- Allergic: eliminate allergen, artificial tears,
    antihistamine/mast-cell stabilizer drops (olopatadine, ketotifen),
    oral antihistamine (diphenhydramine, loratadine)

- Viral: 4-8x/day artificial tears, cold compresses, isolation
    precautions.

- Bacterial: culture/swab the ocular discharge, isolation precautions,
    moxifloxacin drops (Vigamox) QID or trimethoprim/polymyxin B
    drops/ointment for 5-7 days

- Consult ophthalmology if concern for worsening
