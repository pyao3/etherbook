# Fungemia and Intraocular Involvement

Jonathan A. Barnett

The American Academy of Ophthalmology currently does NOT recommend
routine Ophthalmology consults for visually asymptomatic patients with
systemic candidemia. The incidence of candidemia-related endophthalmitis
detected from routine screenings is <1%.

By contrast, if the patient has visual symptoms, an Ophthalmology
consult is warranted.

## Giant Cell Arteritis: Role of Ophthalmology

If a patient has systemic symptoms suspect of GCA (see “Rheumatology
section”), when is it appropriate to consult Ophthalmology?

- If patient HAS visual symptoms (acute vision loss, new onset
    diplopia), consult ophthalmology.

- If patient DOES NOT have visual symptoms, DO NOT consult
    ophthalmology (e.g., to rule out “retinal vasculitis.”)

- It is extremely unlikely that Ophthalmology will find a pertinent
    ocular finding in the absence of visual symptoms to support a
    diagnosis of GCA.

- Bottom line: If you suspect GCA given the other systemic symptoms
    (regardless of visual status), treat promptly with high dose
    steroids!

- Temporal Artery biopsies are typically performed by Vascular
    Surgery.
