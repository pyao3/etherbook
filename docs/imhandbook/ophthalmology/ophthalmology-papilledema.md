# Papilledema

## Background

- Papilledema refers to edema of the optic nerve due to increased
    intracranial pressure

- Ophthalmology is often consulted to rule out papilledema in patients
    who fit the “Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH)” profile, or
    with patients with other reasons for high ICP

## Presentation

- Symptoms of increased ICP: headaches that vary with position (often
    worse with bending over), nausea, vomiting, neck
    stiffness/meningismus, pulsatile tinnitus, fevers/chills

- Visual symptoms of papilledema: transient visual obscurations,
    dimming of vision, blurry vision, loss of color vision/red
    desaturation, loss of peripheral vision, scotoma.

##Evaluation and Management

- Consult Ophthalmology and Neurology if concerned for papilledema.
    Neurosurgery should be involved if there is concern for shunt
    failure or other neurosurgical problem.

- Ophthalmology / Neurology will advise on what imaging to order
    (usually MRI / MRV brain with and without contrast, + MRI Orbits
    with and without contrast and fat suppression)

- If no contraindications after imaging, obtain LP with opening
    pressure, with CSF sent for cells, protein, glucose, and
    infectious/neoplastic workup where appropriate

- Ophthalmology / Neurology may recommend initiation of PO or IV
    acetazolamide (Diamox). These may be contraindicated or need to be
    renally dosed if the patient has chronic kidney disease.
