# Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)

## Background

- A syndrome of diffuse inflammation and injury of the alveoli and
    capillary endothelium leading to fluid and protein accumulation in
    the interstitium and alveoli, pulmonary edema, and hypoxemic
    respiratory failure; 30-50% mortality rate
- Triggers:
- Pulmonary
    - Pneumonia (viral and bacterial) • Lung contusion
    - Direct inhalation injury • Aspiration
    - Primary graft dysfunction of pulmonary transplant
- Extra-pulmonary
    - Sepsis (most common cause) • HSCT
    - Trauma • Burns
    - Massive blood transfusions/TRALI • Pancreatitis
    - Drugs (amiodarone, chemotherapy, cocaine, opioids)

## Evaluation

- Diagnosis: Berlin Criteria
- New or worsening respiratory symptoms beginning within one week of
    diagnosis
- New bilateral opacities present on chest radiograph or CT chest
    - Not explained by effusions, collapse of lobe/lung, or nodules
- Absence of left heart failure or volume overload
- Severity: based on PaO2/FiO2 ratio with a PEEP ≥ 5 cm H2O
- PaO2 = arterial partial pressure of O2 (requires ABG)
- FiO2 = fraction of inspired oxygen (expressed as a decimal between
    0.21 and 1.0)

|          | PaO2/FiO2 ratio | PEEP |
|----------|-----------------|------|
| Mild     | 201-300         | ≥5   |
| Moderate | 101-200         | ≥5   |
| Severe   | \<100           | ≥5   |

## Management

- Frequently requires intubation; non-invasive ventilation not a great
    treatment
- Low tidal volume (Vt) ventilation mortality benefit
- Goal Vt = 4-8 mL/kg of *predicted* body weight (obese patients don’t
    have bigger lungs)
- Plateau pressure goal: ≤30 cm H2O
- Oxygenation goal: PaO2 55-80 or SpO2 88-95%
- pH goal: ≥7.20, “permissive hypercapnia”
- Treat the underlying cause (see “Triggers” above)
