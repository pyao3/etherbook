# Refractory Hypercapnia

Amelia Muhs

## Background

- Inadequate clearance of CO2 leading to respiratory acidosis (pH ≤
    7.20) despite maximum RR&TV (i.e. minute ventilation) tolerated
    without causing barotrauma or autoPEEP
- Common causes:
    - Obstructive lung disease (COPD, emphysema, asthma)
    - Hypoventilation (sleep apnea, obesity, sedative medications (ie
        opiates), neuromuscular weakness, chest wall trauma, ascites/pleural
        effusion)
    - Increased CO2 load (shock, sepsis, malignant hyperthermia)
- Presentation:
    - Shortness of breath
    - AMS, somnolence
    - Hypoxemia
    - Tachycardia, hypertension (in some cases)

## Evaluation

- Physical exam, mental status, recent medications
- ABG or VBG – if increased PCO2 and normal pH, always treat the pH
    and not the PCO2 (i.e., may be compensated chronic hypercarbia and
    blowing off more CO2 may be harmful)

## Management Algorithm

- Special considerations
    - If history of OSA, make sure they are on home CPAP/BiPAP
    - If opiate related trial narcan
    - Bronchodilators for reactive airway diseases
- BiPAP
    - Contraindicated if pt unable to remove BiPAP mask on their own
    - Increase MV by increasing Δ between IPAP/EPAP or increasing RR
- Mechanical ventilation
    - Allows you to control rate and tidal volume (in Volume Control
        modes)
    - NOTE: some pts have higher minute ventilation on their own compared
        to mechanical ventilation (e.g., DKA); pt-specific considerations
        regarding intubation
    - To increase minute ventilation and CO2 clearance:
        - Increase RR
            - 30-35 is about as high as you can go
            - Need to keep in mind I/E time to avoid breath
                stacking/autoPEEP (gas trapped in lungs)
            - Some signs of autoPEEP include worsening hypotension and the
                expiratory limb on the flow waveform on the vent not
                returning to zero
        - Increase TV we usually start at 4-6mL/kg IBW. You can consider
            increasing to 8mL/kg IBW as long as plateau pressures remain \<
            30 cm H2O
            - Goal peak pressures ≤ 35 cm H2O / plateau pressures ≤ 30 cm
                H2O
- ARDS permissive hypercapnia (goal pH ≥ 7.2)
- V-V ECMO / Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO2R)
- Indications for hypercapnia:
    - Severe dynamic hyperinflation and/or severe respiratory acidosis
    - pH ≤ 7.25 with PaCO2 ≥ 60 for 6 hr with RR at 35/min and TV
        increased to target maximum MV while keeping plateau pressure ≤
        32 cm H2O
    - Similar considerations and contraindications as refractory hypoxemia
    (see above)
    - Benefits: Reduces work of breathing, promotes early ventilator
        weaning/extubating allows early mobilization and recovery
