## Background

Most recent definition (Sepsis-3): organ dysfunction from
    dysregulated host response to infection

- 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines: SIRS, MEWS, NEWS superior to qSOFA
    for <u>screening</u> sepsis
- SIRS ≥2 of any of: 1) RR\>20, 2) T \<36 or \>38, 3) HR \>90, 4) WBC
    \<4 or \>12 or \>10% bands
- Septic Shock = sepsis + vasopressors + lactate \>2 meq/dL (Sepsis 3
    definition)
- Alternate screening systems you may see which are more
    <u>specific</u> and better at prognosis of in hospital mortality
    than SIRS:
    - Acute change in baseline SOFA score ≥2: P/F ratio, Plts, Tbili, SBP,
        GCS, Cr
    - "Quick" SOFA (qSOFA): ≥2 of AMS (GCS≤13), SBP≤100 mmHg, RR≥22/min

## Evaluation

- Cultures prior to antibiotics if possible (but don’t delay
    antibiotics just to get cultures)
- Consider sputum Cx, paracentesis, thoracentesis, wound Cx, LP, joint
    aspiration
- Lactate (even if not hypotensive)
- Imaging: x-ray, CT, or US of potential source

## Management

Source control: Remove old lines, chest tube for empyema, drain
    abscesses, etc

Antibiotics

- Early antibiotics: within 1 hour if septic shock, within 3 hours if
    sepsis
- Target organisms most likely to cause infection in suspected organ;
    if source unknown, start empiric broad-spectrum
- MRSA coverage - vancomycin/daptomycin/linezolid/ceftaroline
- Pseudomonas coverage - zosyn/cefepime/meropenem /cipro/gentamicin
- Pneumonia: add atypical coverage (azithromycin/levaquin; 2nd line
    doxycycline if prolonged QTC or elderly) if severe or being admitted
    to the ICU
- Fungal coverage for Candida: if neutropenic, TPN, abdominal surgery,
    prior antibiotics
- De-escalation: Once source is controlled, if abx duration is unknown
    use procalcitonin, culture susceptibilities, and clinical evaluation
    to help guide de-escalation

Resuscitation

- Give 1-3 L (≥30 mL/kg of body weight) of IV balanced crystalloid
    within first 3 hours
- Only give blood if Hb \< 7, unless evidence of bleeding or
    myocardial ischemia
- Monitor HR, BP, mental status, urine output – do NOT give
    beta-blockers to slow HR in the setting of sepsis unless dangerously
    high and limiting diastolic filling (discuss with fellow), this is
    an appropriate stress response
- Assess fluid responsiveness by leg raise (if BP improves with leg
    raise, give more fluids). Other options US IVC (mixed data), pulse
    pressure

Vasopressors

- Start if MAP not responsive to fluid resuscitation
- Target MAP \> 65mmHg, also monitor mental status, serum lactate, and
    urine output; may need higher goal for pts with chronic HTN
- Start with norepinephrine -- via central line, PICC, or port. Can
    run through peripheral IV (at least 18g, proximal to wrist) up to 15
    mcg/min for up to 48 hours if no central access
    - SOAP II trial: norepinephrine \> dopamine (less arrhythmias)
    - No upper limit of NE but can cause peripheral ischemia with
        prolonged use
- Add vasopressin at fixed dose of 0.04 units/min when NE dose \>= 50
    mcg/min
    - VASST trial: possible benefit for pts on 5-15 of NE; however,
        this was opposite of hypothesis and vasopressin is expensive
- Add epinephrine or dobutamine if low cardiac output
- Add phenylephrine for pts with tachyarrhythmias (reflex bradycardia)
- Consider Angiotensin II (discuss with fellow, needs MICU leadership
    approval) contraindicated with CHF and
    DVT/PE/clots/hypercoagulability
- Consider steroids if vasopressors failing or on steroids chronically
    hydrocortisone 100mg IV q8hr or 50mg IV q6hr for 5 to 7 days
