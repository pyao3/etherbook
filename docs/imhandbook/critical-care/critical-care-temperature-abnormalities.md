## Hypothermia

### Background

- Core temperature \<35°C (95°F). Mild 32-35C (90-95F), moderate
    28-32C (82-90F), or severe \<28C (82F) +/- pulseless
- Ensure thermometer is “low-reading,” standard thermometers not
    accurate
- Core temperature can be measured w/ bladder catheter probe or
    esophageal probe (may be falsely ↑ if heated oxygen being
    delivered). Rectal temp can be used but is less accurate
- Etiologies:
    - Heat loss: Environmental, burns, iatrogenic (CRRT, cold IVF, massive
        transfusion protocol), vasodilatory drugs/toxins
    - Decreased heat production: endocrinopathies (hypothyroidism, adrenal
        insufficiency, hypopituitarism, hypoglycemia), thiamine deficiency
    - Impaired regulation: Spinal cord injury, hypothalamic lesions, drugs
        (classes including antihyperglycemics, beta blockers, sedatives,
        ETOH, alpha agonists, general anesthetics)
    - Multiple mechanisms: sepsis, pancreatitis, DKA

### Evaluation

- Infectious work-up
- POC blood glucose, TSH/FT4, cortisol, lipase, UA, UDS, EtOH level,
    additional tox as appropriate, DKA work-up if relevant
- Physical exam + history for exposures and trauma
- CBC, CMP, Lactate, ABG, CK, PT/PTT, Fibrinogen
- EKG

### Management
- Treat underlying cause \[see appropriate sections\]
- Mild hypothermia:
    - Passive external rewarming (PER): blankets, increase ambient
        temperature
    - Note that PER requires sufficient underlying physiologic reserve to
        generate heat. This is often impaired in elderly pts, malnutrition,
        sepsis
- Moderate hypothermia, refractory mild hypothermia, or cardiovascular
    instability:
    - Active external rewarming (AER): forced warm air (ie Bair Hugger),
        heated blankets, heat lamps, hot packs (consider burn risk)
- Severe hypothermia or refractory moderate hypothermia:
    - Active core rewarming: Warmed IV crystalloid (limited rewarming
        potential unless large volume but will decrease ongoing losses),
        warmed humidified inspired air, warmed bladder lavage
    - More extreme methods such as peritoneal/thoracic lavage more likely
        to be used in severe environmental cases in ED
- Pulseless severe hypothermia (“You aren't dead unless you are warm
    and dead”)
    - Continue CPR until re-warmed as severe hypothermia is
        neuroprotective and pts can have good neurologic outcomes despite
        hours of CPR
    - ACLS medications and shocks will have poor effectiveness; prioritize
        circulation (i.e. chest compressions) and rewarming
    - Consider ECMO (likely venoarterial if pulseless); would need
        transfer to CVICU
- Identify and manage complications: bradycardia/heart block,
    arrhythmias, shock, coagulopathy/DIC, rhabdo; rebound
    hyperkalemia/hypoglycemia with rewarming

## Fever and Hyperthermia

### Background

- Fever: T \>38.0°C (100.4°F) driven by hypothalamus activity in
    response to systemic triggers (i.e. cytokines); may use lower
    threshold for immunocompromised pts
- Hyperthermia: T \>41.0 C (105.8°F) uncontrolled heat production with
    failure of thermoregulation
- Infectious etiologies:
    - Considerations in the ICU include central-line associated blood
    stream infection, catheter-associated UTI, pneumonia (including
    ventilator-associated), sinusitis (esp in pts with NGT or ETT),
    *clostridium difficile*, acalculous cholecystitis
- Non-infectious etiologies:
- Drug fever
    - Difficult to distinguish from other causes; Can begin hrs-wks
        after starting a drug
    - Sources: antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins,
        sulfonamides), anticonvulsants (phenytoin, carbamazepine,
        phenobarbital), allopurinol, heparin, dexmedetomidine
    - Drugs of abuse with sympathomimetic activity (cocaine, meth,
        ecstasy)
    - Anticholinergic or salicylate intoxication
- Idiosyncratic drug reactions
    - Serotonin syndrome
    - Neuroleptic malignant syndrome
    - Malignant hyperthermia
- Transfusion reactions
- PE/DVT
- Endocrine: hyperthyroidism/thyroid storm, adrenal insufficiency
- CNS pathology (intracranial bleed/stroke, particularly hypothalamic
    region)
- Malignancy
- Heat stroke (exertional or non-exertional)
- Other inflammatory states: Pancreatitis, gout, pericarditis,
    pneumonitis

### Evaluation

- Infectious work-up +/- LP; may consider pan-scan if unable to
    identify source
- POC glucose, BMP, LFT, Mg/Phos, CBC w/diff
- Consider coags + fibrinogen (DIC), CK/UA (rhabdo), UDS,
    acetaminophen and salicylate levels, TSH/FT4, cortisol, lipase, ABG
- Review medication list: antibiotics, serotonergic drugs,
    anti-psychotics, recent sedation for OR or recently intubated with
    succinylcholine, dexmedetomidine
- Consider CT/MRI head

### Management

- Treat underlying etiology \[see appropriate sections\]
- Serotonin syndrome -\> stop serotonergic drugs; add cyproheptadine
- Malignant hyperthermia -\>activate malignant hyperthermia team; add
    dantrolene
- Cooling
    - Target \<38.0°C (100.4°F)
    - Surface cooling: Ice (bath, or ice packs more likely in our MICU),
        evaporative cooling with misted lukewarm water and fan
    - Internal cooling:
        Cold IV fluids
        (pharmacy keeps ~3L of cold LR on-hand, they will cool more if you call down and ask),
        dry ventilation (evaporative) with non-humidified nasal cannula or vent circuit
    - Avoid shivering -\> give opiates (except in serotonin syndrome),
        precedex, propofol, benzos, ketamine
- Antipyretics
    - Acetaminophen, NSAIDs
    - Block prostaglandin-mediated temperature elevations
    - Effective for most causes of fever- infection, pancreatitis, DVT/PE,
        pneumonitis
    - AVOID for true hyperthermia (ineffective and potentially harmful)
        -\> neuroleptic malignant syndrome, malignant hyperthermia,
        serotonin syndrome, heat stroke
- Monitor for complications
    - Rhabdo, DIC, arrhythmias
- If high suspicion for infection and not improving on antibiotics,
    consider other infectious etiologies including fungal (ex: candida)
