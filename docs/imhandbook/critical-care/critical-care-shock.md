## Distributive Shock

### Background

- Pathophysiology: severe, peripheral vasodilation
- CO/CI increased, SVR decreased, PCWP and RAP normal to low
- Etiologies: sepsis (most common), anaphylaxis, neurogenic, adrenal
    insufficiency, pancreatitis
- Signs/symptoms:
    - Sepsis: localizing signs of infection; tachycardia, tachypnea, may
        be hypo/hyperthermic; POCUS with hyperdynamic cardiac function
    - Anaphylaxis: history of anaphylaxis; urticaria, edema, diarrhea,
        wheezing on exam
    - Neurogenic: history of CNS trauma; focal neurologic deficits on exam
    - Adrenal insufficiency: hx chronic steroid use, may have GI symptoms,
        hyponatremia (common), hyperkalemia (rare), hypoglycemia,
        hypo/hyperthermia, NAGMA
    - Pancreatitis: abdominal pain, elevated lipase, evidence on CT scan

### Management

- Sepsis: see sepsis section
- Anaphylaxis: 0.3mg IM epinephrine ASAP to be repeated q5-15min x 3;
    after third IM epi, consider IVF and epi gtt if persistent
    hypotension. Adjuncts: albuterol nebs for bronchospasm, H1 and H2
    blockers, +/- glucocorticoids (methylprednisolone 1mg/kg).
    EPINEPHRINE SAVES LIVES.
- Neurogenic: caution with IVF resuscitation, can worsen cerebral and
    spinal cord edema; preferred pressors are norepinephrine and
    phenylephrine; for neurogenic shock 2/2 spinal cord pathology,
    consider higher MAP goal 85-90 mmHg
- Adrenal insufficiency: stress dose steroids with hydrocortisone
    100mg IV q8hr or 50mg q6hr
- Pancreatitis: IVF + pressors; trend H/H and Ca; treat complications
    (necrotizing pancreatitis, abdominal compartment syndrome); address
    underlying etiology (see GI section)

## Cardiogenic Shock

### Background

- Pathophysiology: CO/CI decreased, SVR increased, PCWP and RAP
    elevated (left heart failure) or PCWP low/normal and RAP elevated
    (right heart failure)
- Etiologies: Cardiomyopathy (LHF, RHF or biventricular), arrhythmia,
    mechanical such as acute AR (ex: dissection) or MR (ex: ruptured
    papillary muscle)

### Presentation

- Edematous, elevated JVP, “cold and wet”; hypoxia w/crackles and pulm
    edema; mixed venous sat \< 50-60%; POCUS with plump,
    non-compressible IVC, reduced EF, and B-lines

### Management

See cardiogenic shock in cardiology section

## Hypovolemic Shock

### Background

- Etiologies: Hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic
- Signs/symptoms:
    - Hemorrhagic: Common sources include GI, retroperitoneal (\*needs
        high index of suspicion), traumatic, intraabdominal, thighs, thorax
    - Non-hemorrhagic: 2/2 GI losses or decreased PO intake
- POCUS with thin, collapsible IVC

### Management (Hemorrhagic)

- Ensure good access with two large-bore (at least 18G) IVs ideally in
    AC or above; Cordis or MAC CVC (can also use dialysis catheter, if
    necessary)
- Hyperacute bleed:
    - 1:1:1 ratio FFP:Plt:RBC (balanced resuscitation), massive
        transfusion protocol (MTP)
    - Monitor iCa and replete (citrated blood products will deplete Ca)
    - Minimize crystalloid if possible, w/primary use to prevent immediate
        hemodynamic collapse (contributes to coagulopathy, hypothermia,
        acidemia, trauma/surgery)
    - Permissive hypotension until source control/transfusions with
        arterial bleeds (high MAP/SBP -\> clot destabilization); trend POC
        lactate/exam to guide
    - Acute traumatic arterial bleed or post-partum hemorrhage consider
        TXA (1-2 gm bolus)
    - Reverse anticoagulation, if applicable
    - Vasopressors -\> generally poorly effective, would start with
        norepinephrine
    - Source control -\> GI, IR, or EGS
- Variceal bleed: See GI Bleeding section for specific management

### Management (Non-Hemorrhagic)

- Aggressive IVF resuscitation (balanced crystalloid); target MAP ≥65
- Can support BP during resuscitation with pressors (usually
    norepinephrine)

## Obstructive Shock

### Background

- Etiologies: Massive pulmonary embolism, tension pneumothorax, and cardiac
    tamponade
- Signs/symptoms:
    - Pulmonary embolism: acute hypotension, known DVT, evidence of R
        heart strain on EKG, POCUS w/enlarged RV, septal bowing, McConnell’s
        sign, ↑ BNP, PE on CTA
    - Tension pneumothorax: history of COPD or fibrotic lung disease,
        ventilated pts w/ high peak pressures, unilateral decreased BS on
        auscultation and tympany on percussion, POCUS without lung sliding,
        CXR w/ PTX and mediastinal shift
    - Cardiac tamponade: elevated JVP, muffled heart sounds, pulsus
        paradoxus, POCUS with diastolic collapse of RV and large pericardial
        effusion (best in subcostal window)

### Management

- Massive pulmonary embolism: see Pulmonary Embolism Section for
    specific management
- Tension PTX: needle decompression using 14-16G needle into the
    second intercostal space at the midclavicular line; call trauma
    surgery or fellow for chest tube ASAP
- Cardiac tamponade: STAT page cardiology or cardiothoracic surgery;
    can temporize hypotension with IVF resuscitation—500-1L IVF boluses
    (may not work if pt is euvolemic or hypervolemic); no proven benefit
    from inotropy (e.g., dobutamine)
