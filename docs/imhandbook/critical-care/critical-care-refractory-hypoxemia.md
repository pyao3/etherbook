# Refractory Hypoxemia

## Background

- Inadequate arterial oxygenation despite high levels of inspired O2
    or the development of barotrauma in mechanically ventilated pts
- Generally start to consider the interventions below if needing FiO2
    \>80%
- Differential:
    - Worsening underlying primary process (e.g. progressive ARDS)
    - PE
    - Pneumothorax
    - Fluid overload
    - Ventilator-associated Pneumonia
    - New ARDS

## Evaluation

- Always get CXR STAT if pt has new or worsening O2 requirement
- ABG is frequently helpful as well
- Can use POCUS to check for lung sliding (pneumothorax) or RV
    enlargement/septal bowing/McConnell’s sign (RV strain in PE)

## Initial management

- Remember – if at any point the pt is rapidly decompensating, you can
    always disconnect them from the vent and bag them until they
    recover/while calling for help
- Early consideration of ECMO consult in appropriate pts (discuss with
    MICU fellow)
- Optimize fluid status consider diuresis/dialysis if not making urine
- Consider higher PEEP strategy
- Increased PEEP higher mean airway pressure, generally improves
    oxygenation especially with diffuse pulmonary pathologies
    - Exceptions may include certain focal/shunt pathologies (e.g.
        dense lobar PNA)
    - Worsening oxygenation may occur with overdistension of alveoli
        increase dead space ventilation; generally determined
        empirically at the bedside
- Titrate up slowly; generally do not exceed PEEP 18
    - Limited by high plateau pressures/barotrauma,
        overdistension/dead space ventilation, decreased preload/venous
        return
- ARDSnet FiO2/PEEP Tables: At VUMC we typically use the Lower PEEP
    table

- Other recruitment maneuvers
    - Reposition pt – can try elevating HOB or positioning so “good lung”
        is down
    - If concern for mucus plug, consider need for bronch
    - If concern for significant atelectasis can try recruitment maneuvers
        with the vent including sustained inflation (setting expiratory
        pressure to \~30 for \~30 seconds) and PEEP titration (setting PEEP
        to 20-25 and decreasing by 2cm at a time) – call the fellow before
        attempting

## Management Algorithm for Refractory Hypoxemia

- Inhaled vasodilators: Distribute preferentially to well-ventilated
    alveoli local vasodilation improved V/Q matching
- VUMC formulary preference: inhaled epoprostenol (aka Flolan)
- Alternatives: inhaled milrinone, inhaled nitric oxide
- Data suggest improved PaO2/FiO2; large RCT without evidence for
    mortality benefit
- Deep sedation (RASS -4 or -5)
    - Promotes ventilator synchrony
- Neuromuscular blockade (paralysis) – call your fellow before doing
    this
    - Rationale: maximal vent synchrony (eliminates residual chest
        wall/diaphragm tone)
    - Pt MUST be RASS -5 (need analgesia + sedation)
    - Trial one time IV push of vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg
    - If improved vent synchrony/oxygenation, consider cisatracurium
        (Nimbex) drip
    - Data are mixed ACURASYS 2010 (improved 90-day mortality but
        underpowered likely overestimating benefit); ROSE 2019 (no
        difference in 90-day mortality)
- Prone positioning (Need attending approval)
    - Pts with moderate to severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 ratio \< 150)
    - At VUMC, we use regular ICU beds and manually flip pts; cycle prone
        16 hrs/supine 8 hrs
    - When proning or supining a pt, always have a provider who can
        intubate in the room in case unplanned extubation occurs
    - Considerations: need a team of people to reposition, high risk of ET
        tube malposition, difficult to access lines/perform procedures, high
        risk of pressure injuries
    - Data: PROSEVA 2013 proning improved 28-day mortality; study
        complicated by imbalances between groups
- Alternative ventilator modes (usually Pressure Control or
    APRV/BiLevel/BiVent)
- APRV/BiVent should be avoided in people with bad obstructive lung
    disease, hemodynamic instability, refractory hypercarbia
- Venovenous (V-V) ECMO
    - Indications for hypoxemia:
        - PaO2/FiO2 \< 50 with FiO2 \>80% for \>3 hrs OR
        - PaO2/FiO2 \< 80 with FiO2 \>80% for \>6 hrs AND
        - Mechanical ventilation ≤ 1 week
    - Absolute Contraindications:
        - Poor short-term prognosis (e.g. metastatic cancer)
        - Irreversible, devastating neurologic pathology
        - Chronic respiratory insufficiency without the possibility for
            transplant
    - Can calculate RESP score predicts in-hospital survival with ECMO
    - CONSULT EARLY if a pt may be a candidate; allows ECMO team to assist
        with evaluation
    - Data:
        - CESAR 2009: improved 6-month survival without severe disability
        - EOLIA 2018 : no mortality benefit but 28% crossover from control
            to ECMO arm dilutes potential effects
