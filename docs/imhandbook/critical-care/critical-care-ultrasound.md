## Volume assessment

- IVC measurements
- Clinical Questions: Will the patient respond to fluid resuscitation?
    Is CVP low or high?
- Protocol: See cardiology POCUS section
- Limitations: Non applicable in patients with elevated abdominal
    pressure or abdominal contractions during measurement
- Troubleshooting: Use the liver as a window to the IVC to avoid bowel
    gas. Start at the right mid-axillary line with the leading edge
    toward the head of the patient, and fan to view the IVC in
    longitudinal axis.

## Lung Assessment

- Lung ultrasound relies on recognition of ultrasound artifacts to
    identify normal and pathologic findings.
- Normal findings
    - “Bat sign”: Ultrasound cannot penetrate reflective rib surface,
        casting a vertical shadow
    - A- lines: hyperechoic horizontal lines descending from the
        pleural line at regular intervals. This reverberation artifact
        occurs in normal aerated lung
- Pathologic findings
    - B-lines, comet tails: Vertical hyperechoic lines which (1)
        extend from the pleural line through the depth of the image, (2)
        move with lung sliding, and (3) obliterate A lines. Multiple B
        lines indicates excess interstitial fluid
    - Lung rockets: \>3 B lines indicates interstitial syndrome. Most
        common cause is acute pulmonary edema, also consider ARDS, PNA,
        pulmonary fibrosis, & pulmonary contusion. Helps distinguish CHF
        vs COPD exacerbation in patients with dyspnea
    - Loss of lung sliding, barcode sign: The shimmering, twinkling
        appearance of the dynamic aerated lung is lost. Can confirm in
        M-mode with barcode sign- smooth homogenous lines indicating no
        movement of lung tissue. Lung sliding=suspicion for PTX but NOT
        specific unless can identify lung point
    - Lung Point: The precise location where the lung detaches from
        the pleura can sometimes be identified. Can confirm in M-mode
        which will show “barcode” and “seashore” patterns adjacent. 100%
        specific for pneumothorax
    - Pleural effusion, jellyfish sign: Anechoic fluid is visualized
        between the diaphragm and dynamic lung
- Probe: linear or phased array
- Protocol
    - Adjust the depth to \~10cm to start. Position the probe vertically
        on the midclavicular line. Slide the probe so that the hyperechoic
        pleural line is visualized between rib shadows. Note
        presence/absence of A lines, B lines, lung sliding, and alveolar
        consolidation
    - Repeat on the opposite side and lower anterior lung fields
    - Repeat on the right and left mid-axillary line, upper and lower
            lung fields. Look for pleural effusion between the diaphragm and
            lung
    - Repeat on the posterior lung fields if indicated to complete a
            12-zone lung examination

## Cardiovascular

Goal-directed echocardiography for acute shock

- Pericardial tamponade
    - Apical 4 chamber (A4C): pericardial effusion, may see end diastolic
        collapse of right atrium
    - Parasternal long (PLAX): pericardial effusion will appear anterior
        to thoracic descending aorta, may see collapsing right ventricle
    - False positives: pericardial cyst, pericardial fat pad, pleural
        effusion (posterior to thoracic descending aorta on PLAX)
- Acute cor pulmonale
    - PLAX, PSAX: paradoxical septal motion, D shaped left ventricle,
        dilated RV
    - A4C: end-diastolic RV area : LV area \> 1
    - Subxiphoid (SUX): dilated IVC
- LVEF- see cardiology section

## Abdominal assessments

- FAST exam
- Clinical questions: Is there fluid in the peritoneal or pericardial
    spaces?
- Probe: curvilinear or phased array
- Protocol
    - Start on abdominal mode at depth 21-25cm. Assess for pericardial
        effusion in SUX view
    - Reduce depth to 12-16cm and place probe on the right anterior
        axillary line between ribs 8-12 with the indicator toward the
        patient’s head. Sweep medially to identify the right kidney.
        Assess for anechoic fluid in Morrison’s pouch between the kidney
        and liver, subdiaphragmatic space, and paracolic gutter. Rock
        the probe to assess for fluid cephalad to the diaphragm. Slide
        inferiorly to confirm no fluid around the inferior pole of the
        kidney
    - Place probe on the left anterior axillary line between ribs 8-11
        with the leading edge toward the patient’s head. Sweep medially
        to identify the left kidney. Assess for anechoic fluid in the
        splenorenal interface, subdiaphragmatic space, pleural space,
        paracolic gutter, and left kidney inferior pole
    - Place probe midline just superior to the pubic symphysis.
        Identify the bladder in longitudinal and transverse view. Assess
        for fluid outside the bladder wall and in the pouch of Douglas
        (females) or rectovesicular space (males)
- Limitations: Cannot detect retroperitoneal bleed. False positives
    from ascites, pleural effusion, subcapsular hematoma, ruptured
    cysts, physiologic fluid in pouch of Douglas, epicardial fat pad.
    Exam may be indeterminant if significant bowel gas or obesity
- Small bowel obstruction assessment
    - Overall SBO ultrasound has \~92% sensitivity and \~97% specificity
        to detect SBO and greater diagnostic accuracy than abdominal XR
    - Probe: curvilinear
    - Protocol: Have the patient lie supine and relax the abdominal wall.
        Place the probe vertically on the abdomen and sweep across all four
        quadrants in sagittal view. Repeat in transverse view. Measure small
        bowel wall thickness and diameter using the caliper tool
    - Signs of SBO:
        - Diameter \> 2cm • Decreased peristalsis
        - Wall thickness \> 4mm • Back and forth stool movement
        - Tanga sign: In severe SBO, may see triangular pocket hypoechoic
            free fluid surrounding the small bowel near the obstruction
- Renal ultrasound
    - Protocol is similar to FAST exam. Fan the probe through each kidney
        in sagittal and transverse view to assess for dilation of the
        collecting ducts. To move the kidney inferiorly, ask the patient to
        take a deep breath
    - Bilateral hydronephrosis and full bladder suggests urinary
        obstruction distal to the ureter
    - Unilateral hydronephrosis suggests nephrolithiasis or ureteral
        obstruction
    - Limitations: Renal US has a reported sensitivity of 70% and
        specificity of 75% to detect nephrolithiasis compared to CT
