# Introduction to Vent Management

## Ventilator Settings

- See table in Modes of Oxygen Delivery for variables adjusted
    in each ventilator mode
- Trigger: what initiates a breath; time, flow, or pressure (pt
    triggers are flow and pressure)

## Static Ventilator Readouts
- Plateau pressure (Pplat): measure with inspiratory hold, assesses
    static lung compliance
- Auto-PEEP: measure with expiratory hold; occurs when volume of
    previous breath is not entirely expelled before the next breath is
    initiated

## Dynamic Ventilator Readouts
- Measured RR: in most modes, pt may trigger breaths above set RR; if
    set and measured RR match consider ↓ respiratory drive (sedation,
    neurologic injury) or iatrogenic over-ventilation
- VTi / VTe: tidal volume of inspiration (VTi) and expiration (VTe)
- VTi should approximately equal VTe, if not then concern for air leak
    (e.g. cuff leak or pneumothorax) or auto-PEEP
- Minute ventilation: calculated from VTe x RR; higher MV = more CO2
    clearance
- Peak pressure: highest pressure reached in the entire ventilator
    cycle

## Critical Non-ventilator hemodynamic readouts
- SpO2: if poor waveform or discordant with PaO2, may need serial ABG
- HR: quickest indicator of emergencies such as pneumothorax, PE,
    ventilator disconnection
- Blood pressure: positive pressure ventilation decreases preload and
    afterload; depending on the underlying pt physiology, increases in
    positive pressure may be detrimental or beneficial for BP
