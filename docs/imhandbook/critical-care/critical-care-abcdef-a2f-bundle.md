# ABCDEF (A2F) Bundle

## Background

- Post-Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS): complex constellation of
    cognitive, physical, and psychological impairments that impact most
    survivors of critical illness, leading to disability, frailty, and
    poor quality of life
- Predicted by (1) duration of immobility and (2) delirium
- Both are reduced by \>80% compliance with ABCDEF (A2F) Bundle
    concepts
- ABCDEF (A2F) Bundle: Interprofessional, evidence-based safety bundle
    of care principles to help reduce LOS, mortality, bounce-backs, and
    the duration of ICU delirium and coma
- Goal: allow pt to “prove us wrong” about readiness for liberation
    from devices, sedatives, etc.

**A**ssess, prevent, and manage pain

- Tools to assess pain using facial expressions, body movements,
    muscle tension, compliance with ventilator, or vocalization for
    extubated pts
- Ex: Critical Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT): scale 0-8,
    uncontrolled pain 3
- Uncontrolled pain increases risk for delirium, limits inspiratory
    effort & weaning from ventilator, and limits ability to mobilize
- Treatment: multi-modal: parenteral opioids, neuropathic meds (e.g.,
    gabapentin, ketamine), adjunctive non-opioids analgesics (e.g.,
    acetaminophen, NSAIDs), nonpharmacologic interventions
    (repositioning, heat/cold)

**B**oth spontaneous awakening trials (SATs) and spontaneous breathing
trials (SBTs)

- SATs = daily sedative interruptions
- RN-driven protocol involving safety checklist: no active seizures,
    alcohol withdrawal, agitation, paralytics, myocardial infarction, or
    increased ICP
- If pass SAT, then proceed to SBT
- If fail SAT (anxiety, agitation, pain, resp distress) restart
    sedation at ½ doses
- SBTs = PS ventilation (Fi02 ≤ 50%, PEEP ≤ 7.5; typically 40% and
    5/5) for ≥ 30 minutes
- RT or physician/APP-driven protocol with safety screen: passed SAT,
    O2 sat ≥ 88%, inspiratory efforts, no myocardial ischemia, no/low
    vasopressor support
- If pass SBT, physician/APP judgment on extubation
- If fail SBT (RR \> 35 or \< 8, O2 sat \< 88%, resp distress, mental
    status change) restart full ventilatory support
- Evidence:
    - Liberated pts from mechanical ventilation 3 days sooner, decreased
        ICU and hospital length of stay by 4 days, and 14% absolute
        reduction in mortality at 1 year

**C**hoice of analgesia and sedation

- Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS): sedation & level of
    arousal assessment tool (Figure 1)
- Target light sedation of RASS -1 to 0 with goal of (1) pt following
    commands without agitation and (2) limiting immobilization
- Over-sedation: hold sedatives till target, then restart at ½ prior
    dose
- Analgosedation with focus on treating pain first and then adding
    sedation meds PRN
- Sedatives: dexmedetomidine (dex) or propofol \>\>\> benzodiazepines
- Benzodiazepines increase risk of delirium in a dose-dependent
    fashion

**D**elirium- assess, prevent, and manage

- Screening for delirium: q4hr using CAM-ICU (Figure 2)
- Affects 60-80% of ventilated pts and associated with increased
    morbidity and mortality, longer ICU and hospital length of stay,
    long-term cognitive dysfunction
- Risk factors and treatment: see Delirium section in Psychiatry

**E**arly mobility and exercise

- Prolonged immobilization during critical illness leads to
    ICU-acquired weakness, associated with worse outcomes: ↑ mechanical
    ventilation, increased hosp length of stay, greater mortality, and
    greater disability
- Consult PT/OT to initiate rehab at the beginning of critical illness
- Can be done safely in pts receiving advanced support

**F**amily engagement and empowerment

- Especially important when pts are unable to communicate themselves
- Incorporate family at the bedside and on rounds to learn pt
    preferences and values, engage in shared-decision making, and
    address questions and concerns
