## Intubation

### Background

- Intubation is the definitive therapy for patients with worsening
    respiratory failure
- Indications for intubation- hypoxic or hypercarbic respiratory
    failure, airway protection

### Intubation checklist

- Prepare the patient
    - IV access: at least two large bore IV access sites.
    - Optimize position: Supine sniffing position
    - Assess the airway: Assess for difficult intubation predictors
        (opening mouth \<3cm, Mallampati ≥ III, neck circumference \>40cm,
        thyromental distance \<6cm, head-neck extension \<30 degrees)
    - Optimal pre-oxygenation: using FiO2 100% (facemask, high flow
        nasal cannula)
    - Optimize medical status: resuscitation, temporize hyperkalemia,
        Hb \>7
- Prepare the equipment
    - Monitoring: SpO2, capnography, telemetry, BP
    - Equipment: bag valve mask, 2 endotracheal tubes (ETT) with cuffs
        checked, direct laryngoscope, videolaryngoscope, bougie/stylet,
        working suction, supraglottic airway, oropharyngeal airway
    - Medications: paralytic (ex: rocuronium, succinylcholine),
        induction sedative (ex: etomidate, ketamine, propofol), analgesics
        (ex: fentanyl), maintenance sedative, IVF hanging in room, pressors
        (ex: Neostick)
- Prepare the team
    - First and second intubators, RT, RN, someone to monitor hemodynamics

### Rapid-sequence intubation (RSI)

- Preferred method of induction, associated with increased
    first-attempt success and fewer intubation-related complications
- Simultaneous IV administration of rapidly acting paralytic and
    induction agents to achieve sedation and paralysis

### Post-intubation

- Ensure correct placement of ETT with capnography and confirming
    bilateral breath sounds
- Secure ETT with taping, tying or tube holder
- Obtain post-placement CXR

### Immediate complications of intubation

- Aspiration: Suction airway, ideally prior to initiation of positive
    pressure ventilation to prevent distal movement of aspirated
    contents. Cricoid pressure maneuver historically used to reduce risk
    but unclear if it works so often not performed
- Cardiovascular collapse: May be hypotension or sympathetic surge
    (hypertension, tachycardia, arrhythmias). Manage with
    fluids/pressors if need, rule out other causes (ex: hypoxia, PTX)
- Hypoxemia: Preoxygenate with 100% FiO2 to minimize risk. Rescue
    maneuvers with bag mask ventilation if needed
- Mechanical injury: Dental, soft tissue, tracheal, laryngeal.
    Retrieve any dislodged teeth, suction blood

## Extubation

### Is the patient ready to be extubated?

- Are they oxygenating well? SpO2 ≥90% with FiO2 ≤50% and PEEP ≤8cm
    H20
- Has the underlying cause of their respiratory failure improved?
- Did patient pass their SBT?
    - See ABCDEF Bundle section for details on SBT
- Is patient able to protect their airway?
- Is the patient on a stable pressor requirement or no pressors?
- Is patient coughing and clearing secretions?
- Is patient off sedation, alert and following commands?
- Positive cuff leak? (See below for steps)
- Consider calculating the rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI):
    RR/tidal volume (L)
    - Set PS at 0cm H2O, and PEEP at 5cm H2O and, measure VT & RR for
        one minute.
    - RSBI ≥ 105 predicts likely failure to wean. The use of a RSBI is
        attending dependent at Vanderbilt and is not frequently
        calculated when assessing readiness for extubation

### Post-extubation complications

- Post-extubation stridor: 2/2 laryngeal edema
- Positive cuff leak test= high risk methylprednisolone 20 mg IV q4h
    x 4 prior to extubation to prevent
- If after extubation: Methylprednisolone 40 mg IV x1 dose + inhaled
    racemic epinephrine. If stridor \>60minutes, consider reintubation
- Cuff leak test:
    - Suction secretions and set the ventilator into the AC mode
    - Inflate the cuff and record inspiratory and expiratory VT to
        evaluate for differences between the two volumes
    - Deflate the cuff record the expiratory VT over the next six
        breathing cycles. Average the three lowest expiratory VT values
    - The cuff leak volume is the difference between the inspiratory
        VT (measured before the cuff was deflated) and the averaged
        expiratory VT. If the difference is \<100cc, this is considered
        failure but is not an absolute contradiction to extubation
- Post-extubation respiratory failure
    - Recurrent hypoxic or hypercarbic respiratory failure
    - Assess for aggravating factors (volume overload, shock, AMS, etc)
    - For hypercarbic respiratory failure, may trial BiPAP. If
        unsuccessful reintubate
    - Preventative post-extubation BiPAP not routinely used in all
        patients but *consider* in select populations at high risk for
        failure: severe COPD with preexisting chronic hypercarbia during
        SBT, patients intubated for cardiogenic pulmonary edema
