# Thyroid Storm 

Gaby Schroeder

---

## Background

- Diagnosis is based on recognition of exaggerated signs/symptoms of thyrotoxicosis leading to multi-organ dysfunction in the setting of precipitating event

- Common Precipitants: Graveâ€™s Disease, surgery, trauma, pregnancy, stress, infection, MI/PE, medication non-compliance, iodine loads

- Use Burch-Wartofsky Point Scale (BWPS); available on MD Calc
    - \> 45: highly suggestive
    
    - 25-44: impending storm
    
    - \< Less than 25: unlikely to represent storm

## Management

- ENDOCRINE EMERGENCY - if suspected consult Endocrine ASAP

- Therapies directed towards thyroid gland
    - PTU: Preferred because it inhibits peripheral conversion of T4 -> T3 as well as production of T4, 500-1000mg loading dose, followed by 250mg q4 -6 hours (PO, rectal)
    - Methimazole: q4-6 hours, dose varies (PO, rectal, IV)

- Therapies directed toward decreasing T4 to T3 conversion
    - Propranolol (60-80mg PO q4)
    - Hydrocortisone (300mg x1, 100mg q8) - treats high incidence of co-existing adrenal insufficiency

- Cholestyramine 4g QID can be considered to reduce enteric recirculation

- Refractory Storm: plasmapheresis and plasma exchange

- Close hemodynamic monitoring, may need vasopressors (consider transfer to ICU)
