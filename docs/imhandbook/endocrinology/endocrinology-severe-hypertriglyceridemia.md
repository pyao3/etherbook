# Severe Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) 

Chloe de Crecy

## Background

- Elevated triglycerides (TG) on a *fasting* lipid panel
    - Normal: <150 mg/dL
    - Moderate HTG: 150-499 mg/dL
    - Moderate to severe HTG: 500-999 mg/dL
    - Severe HTG: >1000 mg/dL

- Nearly all patients with severe HTG have a genetic predisposition and an additional factor known to raise serum TGs (e.g. diabetes, alcohol abuse, oral estrogen therapy, hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, propofol, ART, pregnancy)

- Risks of hypertriglyceridemia: pancreatitis (can occur if serum TG >500 mg/dL), ASCVD

- Signs: xanthomas, hepatosplenomegaly, lipemia retinalis, milky appearance of plasma

- Symptoms: short-term memory loss, abdominal pain, flushing with alcohol

## Evaluation

- Order lipid panel for: usual outpatient screening, acute pancreatitis, cutaneous xanthomas, family members with familial HTG, monitoring HTG treatment

- Note: Sodium, glucose, amylase, LDL readings can be affected by HTG

- Consider sending A1c, Cr, TSH

- Assess medication list for secondary causes

## Management

- HTG induced pancreatitis
    - If pt has hypocalcemia, lactic acidosis, or multi-organ dysfunction
        - Initiate plasmapheresis and monitor serum TG after each cycle until <500
        - Severe dietary fat restriction (<5%) until TG <1000

    - If none of the above and pt is hyperglycemic
        - Start insulin gtt, IVF, monitor q1h BG and q12h TG
        - Discontinue insulin when serum TG <500
        - Severe dietary fat restriction (<5%) until TG <1000

    - If none of the above and patient is euglycemic
        - Monitor q12h TG until <500
        - Severe dietary fat restriction (<5%) until TG <1000
        - Consider initiation of insulin gtt as well (regardless of BG level) as insulin will help metabolize TG particles

- Long-term Management (once TG <1000, otherwise decreased efficacy)
    - Pharmacologic: fibrates (most commonly fenofibrate), statins, niacin, omega-3 fatty acids
    - Nonpharmacologic: discontinue alcohol use, dietary fat and sugar restriction (target fat intake at <10% of calorie intake), exercise
