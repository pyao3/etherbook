# Hypothyroidism

Griffin Bullock

## Background

- Elevated TSH and low FT4 (primary hypothyroidism)
    - Hashimoto’s (autoimmune) thyroiditis, iodine deficiency, drugs (amiodarone, dopamine antagonists), adrenal insufficiency, thyroid hormone resistance (genetic), non-thyroidal illness (recovery phase), post-surgery or ablation for hyperthyroidism
- Elevated TSH and normal FT4: subclinical hypothyroidism

- Low-Normal TSH, low FT4: central hypothyroidism, sick euthyroid

## Presentation

- Often non-specific and vague: fatigue, cold intolerance, weight gain, constipation, dry skin, myalgia, edema menstrual irregularities, depression, mental dysfunction

- Goiter, bradycardia, diastolic hypertension, delayed relaxation following reflex testing

- Lab abnormalities: microcytic anemia, hypercholesterolemia, hyponatremia, elevated CK

## Evaluation

- TSH: If elevated repeat TSH and obtain T4

- Lipid panel, CBC, BMP

## Management

- Treatment required if ↓ T4, significantly ↑ TSH (>10), or symptoms with any lab abnormality

- Titrate therapy to a normal TSH (unless central hypothyroidism, then target free T4 levels)

- Observation of asymptomatic pts with subclinical hypothyroidism (normal T4, mild ↑ TSH)

- Treatment is with formulation of T4 (full replacement is approximately 1.6 mcg/kg/day)

- Initial Dose:

    - Young/healthy patients: full anticipated dose

    - Older patients or patients with CAD: 25-50 mcg daily

- Increased doses required for: pregnancy, estrogen therapy, weight gain, PPI therapy, GI disorders (↓ absorption), ferrous sulfate therapy

## Additional information

- Pts should take Levothyroxine alone, 1 hr prior to eating to ensure appropriate absorption

- Of note, missed doses can be taken along with the next dose

- Symptoms improve in 2-3 weeks. TSH steady state requires 6 weeks

- Dose can be titrated every 6 weeks based on TSH

- Pregnancy: Pregnancy causes lab changes due to differing levels thyroid binding globulin. Use tables based on trimester to interpret values

    - TPO antibody testing should be conducted if abnormal as this affects risk of complications

- Hypothyroid pts are at increased risk for preeclampsia, placental abruption, preterm labor/delivery

- Refer to endocrine for close monitoring and adjustment to avoid fetal complications

- Inpatients who are pregnant and have abnormal TFTs warrant endocine consult.
