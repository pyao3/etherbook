## Background

- Low TSH and High T4 and/or T3 (primary): Graves’ disease, Toxic goiter, TSH-producing adenoma, hyperemesis gravidarum, subacute granulomatous thyroiditis, amiodarone, radiation, excessive replacement, struma ovarii

- Low TSH/Normal T4 and T3: Subclinical hyperthyroidism, central hypothyroidism, non-thyroidal illness, recovery from hyperthyroidism, pregnancy (physiologic)

- Subclinical Hyperthyroidism: repeat testing to verify abnormality is not transient

## Presentation

- Anxiety, emotional lability, heat intolerance, tremor, palpitations, increased appetite, unexplained weight loss, new onset atrial fibrillation, myopathy, menstrual disorder, exophthalmos, tachycardia, pretibial myxedema, hyperreflexia, lid lag, changes to hair or skin

## Evaluation

- TSH, free T4, free T3 (only T3 or T4 may be elevated, though both often are)

- Biotin affects assay, causes falsely ↓ TSH and falsely ↑ FT4/FT3

- CBC: May have a normocytic anemia due to increased plasma volume

## Management

- Thyrotropin antibodies (Graves-specific test, not sensitive)

- Radioiodine uptake scan if thyrotropin antibodies negative

    - Note: if pt has had a contrasted study wtih radioactive iodine in the past 6 weeks, the RAI update scan will not be helpful 

- Treatment: methimazole, PTU, beta blockers, radioiodine ablation, surgery

- Pts should be referred to endocrinology for treatment plan based on work up
