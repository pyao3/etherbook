# Adrenal Insufficiency 

Griffin Bullock

## Background

- Differential: Primary (Adrenals) vs Secondary (Pituitary):
    - Exogenous steroid use (>10 mg for >3wks) undergoing severe physiologic stress or sudden discontinuation of steroid
    - Autoimmune adrenal insufficiency
    - Infection/Infiltration: tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, malignancy
    - Hemorrhage (Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome)
    - Pituitary mass/tumor, infarct, infiltration, surgery, trauma 

## Presentation

- Generalized weakness, lightheaded, abdominal pain, nausea, weight loss, fatigue

- Lab Abnormalities: hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia

## Evaluation

- Inpatient Setting
    - Draw AM cortisol and ACTH (ideally 8am) -> 0.25mg cosyntropin -> cortisol 1 hour after 
        - Cortisol level â‰¥18-20 rules out primary adrenal insufficiency (and most secondary)
        
- Outpatient Setting
    - Draw AM cortisol level for screening (>15 rules typically rules out adrenal insufficiency)
    - ACTH stimulation for confirmation

## Management

- Consult endocrine if ACTH stimulation test is abnormal
- Adrenal crisis (if concerned, treat first, test later)
    - BMP, glucose monitoring, ACTH level, serum cortisol
    - Fluid resuscitation: NS or D5NS. Do not use hypotonic saline
    - Hydrocortisone 100mg x1 followed by 50mg q8h
