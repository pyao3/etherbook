# Stress Dose Steroids 

Griffin Bullock

## Primary Options

- Dexamethasone 4 mg IV: does not affect cortisol assays, ideal if diagnosis uncertain

- Hydrocortisone 100 mg IV bolus then 50 mg q8h until stable: greater mineralocorticoid activity. Ideal if adrenal insufficiency known/confirmed or if hyperkalemic (K>6.0)

## When to Use

- Concern for adrenal crisis
- Patients with known adrenal insufficiency:
    - Minor Illness: â†‘ dose x3 for 3 d or until clinically improved & acute stress resolved
- Surgery: dependent on severity of operation
    - Minor (e.g. hernia repair): hydrocortisone 25 mg for 1 day
    - Moderate (e.g. cholecystectomy): 50-75 mg day of surgery and post-op day 1
    - Major (e.g. CABG): 100-150 mg daily 2-3 days (would consult endocrine in this setting)
    - Trauma, critical illness, or unclear give stress dose
