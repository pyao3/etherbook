# Thyroid Nodules

## Background

- ~50% of adults will have a thyroid nodule on ultrasound

- Benign: goiter, cyst, inflammatory, Hashimoto’s, follicular adenoma (microadenoma)

- Malignant: follicular, papillary, medullary, anaplastic, metastatic, thyroid lymphoma

- Risk factors for malignancy: age <30, head or neck radiation, family history of thyroid cancer

## Evaluation

- TSH, Free T4, Thyroid U/S

## Management

- If Low TSH: Likely a hyperfunctioning "hot" nodule (benign in 95% of cases)

    - Order Iodine-123 or technetium-99m thyroid scan

        - If hyperfunctioning → measure T3/free T4 if ↑, treat for hyperthyroidism

        - If non-functioning → proceed as if TSH were normal

- Normal or elevated TSH:

    - FNA indicated based on U/S findings listed below (determined by TI-RADS system)

        - Nodules >1 cm that have high- or intermediate-suspicion pattern

        - Nodules >1.5 cm that have low-suspicion pattern

        - Nodules >2 cm that have very-low-suspicion pattern

- FNA cytology determines the plan of action:

    - Benign → periodic US monitoring at 12-24 months, then at increasing intervals

    - Indeterminate → repeat FNA in 3-12 months

    - Malignant → surgical referral

- Nodules that do not meet FNA criteria, US findings determine the timing for follow-up imaging:

    - High suspicion: 6-12 months

    - Low to intermediate suspicion: 12-24 months

    - Nodules >1 cm with very ↓ suspicion OR pure cyst: >24 months if at all

- Nodules <1 cm with very ↓ suspicion OR pure cyst: no further imaging necessary
