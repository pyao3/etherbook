# Hypoglycemia 

Will Bassett

---

## Background

- Definition: BG <70 mg/dL in a patient on insulin or an oral hypoglycemic; <55 mg/dL for other patients

    - Generally worse outcomes than hyperglycemia

- Causes: infection, liver failure, iatrogenic (e.g. insulin not adjusted for AKI or being NPO)

- Symptoms vary from tremor, palpitations, delirium, dizziness, AMS, coma

## Management

- Give PO carbohydrate load (15-20g oral glucose) if pt is alert and tolerates PO

- Give IV D50 if severe (<50), or cannot take PO

- Repeat measurements after 15 minutes and treat again as needed

    - As a rule of thumb, 15g of carbs should raise BG within 15 minutes

- Give glucagon 0.5-1mg SQ/IM if no IV access and impaired consciousness

    - Effect is transient and IV access should be obtained ASAP for glucose infusion

- Do NOT hold basal insulin for T1DM: treat the low, then reduce dose if needed
