# Multiple Sclerosis

## Background

- Progressive inflammatory disorder primarily manifesting with
    demyelination of the central white matter

- Optic neuritis and transverse myelitis (spinal cord lesion) are
    common presentations

- Generally develop over a few days; very uncommon to happen suddenly
    (e.g., patients will complain about a dark spot appearing in their
    vision that expands over several days)

## Evaluation

- MRI w/ and w/o contrast can identify plaques and determine if they
    are more acute

    - “Active” MS plaque will enhance, and continues to for weeks (even
        after treatment)

- Modified MacDonald Criteria: ≥3 characteristic demyelinating lesions
    (\>1 cm, periventricular, infratentorial (brainstem/cerebellum/cord)
    or juxtacortical in location) with evidence of separation in time
    (active and chronic)

- LP with studies for oligoclonal bands, IgG index, cell count and
    protein, anti-mog, anti-aqp4

## Management

- Treat flares and optic neuritis with steroids

    - Speeds up recovery, but does not improve the degree of recovery

    - Often dosing starts with methylpred 1g

- If a patient with known MS has worsening symptoms that are not new,
    then recrudescence is the likely cause infectious/toxic/metabolic
    workup and imaging is needed

- There are several long-term medications; common side effects listed
    below:

    - Interferon (SQ injections) – flu-like symptoms, injection site
        reactions

    - Glatiramer acetate (SQ) – injection site reactions

    - Fingolimod (PO) – macular edema, liver injury, increased risk of
        skin cancer

    - Teriflunomide (PO) – liver injury, hair loss, immunosuppression,
        teratogenic

    - Dimethyl fumarate (PO) – GI side effects, lymphocytopenia, liver
        injury

    - Natalizumab (IV) – PML concern, immunosuppression

    - Ocrelizumab (IV) – contraindicated in active HBV infection, cannot
        give live vaccines

    - Alemtuzumab (IV) – autoimmune disease, rash, headache

# Neuromyelitis Optica and Spectrum Disorder

- Demyelinating disease due to Ab against aquaporin-4 (on
    oligodendrocytes)

- Classically causes optic neuritis and longitudinally extensive
    transverse myelitis

    - Can be more aggressive than MS

- Diagnose with NMO antibodies and MS workup as above

- Treated with steroids, but in severe or refractory cases may require
    PLEX
