# Status Epilepticus

## Background

-   Either a single seizure >5 minutes or
    ≥
    2 seizures occurring without a return to baseline in between
    \[previous guidelines used 30 minutes as a marker, but this has been
    updated\]
-   Differentiating convulsive seizures from non-epileptic events
    (“pseudoseizure”):
    -   Features that suggest non-epileptic/psychogenic event include
        moaning or talking throughout the event, “no-no” head shake,
        repetitive movements of opposing muscle groups, very arrhythmic
        or purposeful-looking movements, or seizures that have been
        ongoing for “hours”

## Evaluation

-   Fingerstick
    glucose, BMP/CBC, and UDS
-   Consult Neurology
-   EEG (start with 2hr) to determine if it is seizure or not and for
    titration of medications
-   Consider a non-contrasted head CT; MRI cannot be obtained while EEG
    is attached
-   Up to half of pts presenting in status epilepticus have no history
    of seizure, so they need urgent head imaging, consideration for
    lumbar puncture, infectious and toxic workup, tox screen, and
    sometimes rheumatologic or paraneoplastic workup
-   If HX of seizure or on Antiseizure meds (ASMs) please order trough levels 

## Management

- ABCs! Start with benzos:

    - 2 mg lorazepam IV then repeat q1-3 minutes up to 0.1 mg/kg OR

    - 5 mg of diazepam IV every minute (takes longer to give diazepam so
        would give concurrent ASM)

    - 10 mg IM midazolam if no IV access

- After 2 rounds of benzos, would shift to antiepileptics if still in
    status (neurology should be contacted here if not already):

    - IV fosphenytoin 20 mg/kg

    - IV levetiracetam 30-60 mg/kg **(generally 3g, up to 4.5g max)**

    - IV valproic acid 30 mg/kg

- If still seizing at this point, the patient will likely need
    intubation

- These pts MUST be placed on EEG if they get paralyzed or sedated
    because convulsive status often continues as nonconvulsive status,
    which still damages the brain!

    - If still seizing, patients should be on midazolam, propofol or
        barbiturate infusions

    - Focal seizures, such as arm or face twitching with retained
        awareness do not always need to be treated to the point of
        initiating coma
