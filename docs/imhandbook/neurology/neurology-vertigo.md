# Vertigo

## Background

- Clinical Presentation

    - Sensation of the room spinning or moving, or themselves spinning or
        moving

    - Must distinguish from orthostasis/presyncope via history

- Causes: most easily differentiated based on chronicity and triggers
    rather than description of symptoms

    - BPPV - short duration, very positional, classically nystagmus is
        horizontal and torsional with the posterior canal being most
        commonly involved

    - Vestibular neuronitis/labyrinthitis – typically follows URI or ear
        infections; often self-limited, but can be severe/prolonged, in
        which case it is treated with steroids

    - Menière’s Disease – tinnitus and low range frequency hearing loss,
        generally progressive and treated with diuretics, meclizine and
        sometimes surgeries or intratympanic injections

    - Endolymphatic Leak – usually following trauma or concussive blasts,
        requires ENT eval and management. Classically a loud sound will
        cause vertigo and nystagmus

    - vertiginous migraine: usual migraine triggers, may have aura.
        Episodic nature and often positive family hx of migraine or even
        vertiginous migraine.

    - Stroke – sudden onset, ask about vascular risk factors, rare cause
        of isolated vertigo

## Evaluation/Management

- Careful exam of vertigo will be more helpful than random scans, but
    pt has to be symptomatic for exam to mean anything:

    - HINTS Battery – Head Impulse test, Nystagmus pattern, Test of skew

        - Central pattern – no corrective saccade, multidirectional
            nystagmus, skew present

        - Peripheral pattern – corrective saccade, unidirectional
            nystagmus, no skew present

    - Dix-Hallpike Test

    - Cerebellar testing: FNF, HKS, mirroring, gait

    - Outpatient Vestibular function testing with ENT

- Central patterns will need head and vessel imaging (looking for
    vertebral dissection or basilar clots)

    - Often, central vertigo is due to centrally acting medications

- Peripheral causes are varied and often require eval by ENT as an
    outpatient

- Treatment with anticholinergics like meclizine or scopolamine is
    often helpful

- Vestibular therapy with OT is also very beneficial
