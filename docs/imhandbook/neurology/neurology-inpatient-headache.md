# Inpatient Headache (HA)

## Background

- Important to distinguish primary and secondary headache

- Red flags for secondary headaches (SNOOPP): Systemic symptoms,
    Neurologic symptoms, Onset that is sudden (thunderclap), Older age
    (new headache \>40), Progression or evolution in previous headaches,
    Postural component

- Other red flags: preceding trauma, headache awakening patient from
    sleep, no headache-free intervals, thunderclap headache (maximal
    intensity develops within 11 minutes or less)

## Evaluation

- Get a good description of where the pain is, when, associated
    symptoms, and assess for “red flag” features listed above

- If there are any red flag features imaging and workup are necessary

- Imaging depends on highest suspicions, but CTA head/neck is
    appropriate to evaluate for aneurysm (including neck to consider
    dissection). If any focal signs, MRI is generally preferred; venous
    imaging can be beneficial in headaches with features of elevated ICP

- If no red flag features, then workup is not necessary, and focus is
    on treatment

## Management

- NSAIDs and Tylenol for infrequent headaches, but consistent use
    (\>2-3 a week) runs the risk of rebound headaches

- Triptans for migraine, but contraindicated in patients with CAD,
    uncontrolled HTN, previous stroke. They must be used within 6 hour
    of onset
    
    - There are theoretical concerns of serotonin syndrome when used with
        SSRI/SNRIs

- Migraines:

    - “Migraine cocktail”: 1L fluid bolus, 4g Mg, IV Compazine(10mg) OR
        Phenergan(20mg) with Benadryl (25mg)

    - 2<sup>nd</sup> line: Depakote 1000 mg IV, decadron 10mg IV , +/-
        toradol 30mg IV, flexeril 10mg PO

- Cluster headache:

    - Triptans, high flow O2 (\>10 L), sometimes intranasal lidocaine if
        no arrhythmia history
