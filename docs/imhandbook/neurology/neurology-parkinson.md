# Parkinson’s Disease

## Clinical Presentation

- Resting tremor is typically a very early symptom, often worse on one
    side

- Cogwheel rigidity; can be confused for paratonia, which is seen in
    demented or encephalopathic patients who have involuntary variable
    resistance movements during passive ROM assessment

- Speech changes (low volume), hand-writing changes (slow small
    movements)

- Gait changes

    - Festination – slow start with movements that gradually build up
        speed

    - En bloc turning – taking multiple steps to turn around


- Anosmia and REM behavior sleep disorders are very common

## Evaluation

- Clinical diagnosis; there are some supportive imaging studies like
    DaTscan that looks for activity of substantia nigra (usually not
    necessary)

- Clinical response to dopamine replacement is so typical that if a
    patient does not respond, it is important to consider a Parkinson
    plus syndrome (see below)

## Management

- Dopamine replacement – carbidopa/levodopa; dosed at regular
    intervals several times a day. These generally do not need to be
    held on admission.

    - If pt is altered, can hold anticholinergics, MAO-B inhibitors or
        COMT inhibitors

- Dopamine agonists – can cause confusion, hallucinations, dyskinesias

- MAO-B inhibitors (MAOIs): can cause confusion, hallucinations,
    insomnia and dyskinesias

- COMT inhibitors – can cause confusion, hallucinations, insomnia, and
    dyskinesias

- Anticholinergics – useful for tremor when there is not much
    bradykinesia or gait disturbances. In older pts cognitive changes
    are a bigger concern along with hallucinations

- PD medications are rarely titrated in the hospital because acute
    medical illness makes PD symptoms worse and everything will need to
    be re-adjusted as an outpatient

- Be cautious with PRN anti-emetics in patients with PD. Many work via
    dopamine antagonism. Zofran is generally the safest option.

- Similarly, many antipsychotics have dopamine antagonism. Safest
    option is seroquel
    
# Parkinson Plus Syndromes

## Evaluation

- Consider if atypical features such as bilateral symmetric onset,
    early cognitive/personality changes, cerebellar findings, or
    prominent autonomic dysfunction early

# Types

- Progressive Supranuclear Palsy

    - PD symptoms with early falls and minimal tremor

    - Vertical eye movement abnormalities


- Multisystem Atrophy

    - Profound orthostatic hypotension without any increase in HR

    - Three types:

        - MSA-A – autonomic features prominent (previously Shy-Drager
            Syndrome)

        - MSA-P – prominent atypical Parkinsonism features

        - MSA-C – prominent cerebellar dysfunction


- Lewy Body Dementia

    - Parkinsonism with prominent early cognitive impairment and
        hallucinations
