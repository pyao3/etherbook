# Seizure without Status Epilepticus

## Background

-   Risk factors: birth trauma, prematurity, TBI with loss of
    awareness > 1 hour, strokes/tumors/abscesses, history of
    meningitis/encephalitis
-   Key for seizures: stereotyped event with sudden onset/offset
    -   Generally, if full body systems are involved (e.g., jerking or
        tonic activity, then there will also be loss of awareness)

## Evaluation

-   A clear description or recording of seizure semiology is helpful
-   Provoked seizures can develop with medications, hypo/hyperglycemia,
    significant electrolyte abnormalities (e.g. hyponatremia), and CNS
    infections
-   EEG is necessary for spell capture
-   MRI brain with and without contrast once stable

## Non-Epileptic Spells (aka PNES, psychogenic non-epileptic spells)

- Can be very difficult to distinguish from epileptic seizures

- Features more common in PNES

    - Retained awareness with bilateral extremity “seizing”

    - Opisthotonus (arching the back)

    - Talking during a spell

    - Excessively long spells (e.g. lasts hour or days)

    - Forced eye closure

    - Coachability during a spell or reacting to external stimuli

    - Heavy breathing during a spell with lots of rigorous movement

    - Immediately returning to normal after a spell

- Features more common in epileptic seizures:

    - Seizures arising out of sleep

    - Highly stereotyped

    - Incontinence

    - Severe injuries (e.g. burns)

- Management

    - Try to avoid excessive BZD use

    - This requires good clinical judgement as you wouldn't want to
        withhold Ativan and discover that the pt was having true atypical
        seizures. The compromise would be: do not repeatedly administer BZDs
        when there is suspicion for PNES as well as no evidence of response
        to prior BZD administration.

## Syncopal Convulsions

- Very common, can present with posturing and tonic-clonic movements
    happening for a few moments after syncope

    - Should not last for more than 30 seconds

    - These are just related to syncope and do not typically require
        seizure medications

    - Workup:

        - Two-hour EEG and MRI (with and without contrast)

        - Infectious workup, BMP, CBC, blood glucose, toxicology/drug
            screen

        - If there is concern for convulsive syncope, (carefully) check
            orthostatic vitals
