# Stroke

## Background

- <b> Preferred term: Stroke (CVA is like saying heart attack instead of STEMI) </b>
- Sudden onset, focal (usually one-sided) neurologic deficits: weakness, sensory loss, vision loss, ataxia/unsteadiness, vertigo, double vision, facial droop, dysarthria, aphasia

- Differential:
    - stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic)

    - seizure or post-ictal paralysis

    - headache phenomena (complex migraine)

    - cervical spinal cord lesions, though these more commonly cause bilateral symptoms

- Stroke-like symptoms can also develop as recrudescence â€“ previous stroke or brain lesion symptoms worsening with systemic toxic/metabolic/infectious processes or hypotension

## Evaluation

-Critical decision-making information: last known normal (LKN), time symptoms first observed, anticoagulation status, recent surgeries, history of bleeding (severe GIB or ICH), recent medications, platelet count, and baseline neuro exam

- If symptoms developed with LKN within 24 hours -> stroke alert!

- <b> If > 24 hours, can request Neuroalert Instead </b> 

    - VUMC: call 11111 and tell the operator stroke alert and current patient location

    - NAVA: call an RRT and stat page 835-5137, include in the page 911 at the end of the call back number to signal it is a stroke alert

- Stat head CTP (order CTH/CTA) for consideration of tPA or endovascular therapy
    - If renal function is abnormal, discuss with neurology

    - Generally, go for CTA if the patient is a thrombectomy candidate (within 24 hrs of onset)

    - MRI/MRA is an option but takes longer (MRAs are also better with Gadolinium)

    - Neurology service should be leading this portion

## Management

- Blood pressure goals
    - Ischemic stroke:

        - In general aim for SBP <220

        - Patients with intracranial atherosclerosis may require higher BP to maintain perfusion

    - Hemorrhagic stroke:

        - SBP < 140 (BP management is key)

        - These pts are managed in Neuro ICU

        - Reverse coagulopathies and keep platelets >100,000
