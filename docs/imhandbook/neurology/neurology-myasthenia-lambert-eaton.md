# Myasthenia Gravis (MG) and Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS)

## Background

- Disorders of the neuromuscular junction

- MG affects the post-synaptic cleft at the acetylcholine receptor

- LEMS affects the pre-synaptic cleft at the calcium channels

    - Many cases are paraneoplastic (classically small cell lung
        carcinoma)

## Presentation

- Double vision, ptosis, dysarthria, dysphagia

- Dyspnea looks different than in other conditions: air hunger,
    usually also with dysphagia

- Initially, the patient may not look sick or distressed, but may have
    a short inspiratory time or difficulty speaking in complete
    sentences due to shallow breathing

- Most pts have a known history of myasthenia, but up to 20% present
    initially with crisis

## Evaluation

- Exam


    - Look closely for ptosis, nasal speech, weak neck flexion/extension
        (same nerve roots as diaphragm), interrupted speech to take extra
        breaths

    - These patients do not exhibit “huffing and puffing” like in
        COPD/asthma exacerbations

        - Patients with NMJ disease can go from talking to intubated
            within several hours!

    - LEMS: less ocular weakness, but do have extremity weakness and
        absent reflexes.

    - Pulmonary compromise is very rare in LEMS

- EMG/NCS


    - MG: decremental response to repetitive stimulation

    - LEMS: increased amplitude in response to repetitive stimulation

- Labs

    - Myasthenia antibody panels (send prior to IVIG/PLEX being given)

- Imaging

    - Consider chest CT to look for thymic hyperplasia

## Management

- Monitor NIF (negative inspiratory force) at baseline and q4h

    - Measure of diaphragmatic strength

    - Normal is \<-60

    - If below -30, consider elective intubation

    - Note that patient effort will affect NIF values

- IVIG or PLEX

    - Both have similar supportive evidence; IVIG is usually easier to do

    - PLEX has the risks you would expect with dialysis (e.g. fluid
        shifts) and coagulopathy

    - IVIG -\> check IgA levels. Can increase risk of DVT, has risk of
        aseptic meningitis and provides significant fluid load so not ideal
        for pts with CHF

- Steroids

    - Usually up-titrated SLOWLY (by 10-20 mg prednisone daily)

    - Rapid increases in steroids can worsen patients with MG**, so talk
        to neuro before adjusting**

- Pyridostigmine

    - Typically continue at their home dose

    - Too much pyridostigmine can make patients worse (more secretions),
        so for those doing poorly on \>90 mg per dose, consider lowering the
        dose

- Treat underlying causes of exacerbations: usually infections or
    other toxic/metabolic insults

- Remove/avoid exacerbating medications: fluoroquinolones,
    aminoglycosides, beta blockers, and magnesium

- LEMS specific management:

    - 3,4-diaminopyridine

    - Can respond to IVIG or pyridostigmine

    - **Workup for underlying neoplasm**
