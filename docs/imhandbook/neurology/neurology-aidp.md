# Acute Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (AIDP)

## Background

- Rapid onset polyneuropathy that manifests most often with ascending
    weakness and numbness that can involve the respiratory and facial
    musculature

- Usually preceded by infectious illness a few weeks prior

- **Patients are much more likely to get AIDP from an infection than
    any vaccine, weak vaccine links to AIDP are an addition 1-2 cases
    per million flu vaccines.**

## Presentation

- Acute, progressive extremity weakness, weak or absent reflexes, and
    potentially subjective sensatory changes, especially back pain
    
    - There are a TON of variants of AIDP, with some having cranial nerve
        weakness early, proximal weakness, sensory ataxia, primarily sensory
        loss, or rapid muscle weakness; do not use lack of classic ascending
        weakness to dismiss the idea of AIDP

    - Sensory loss is common in an ascending pattern too

## Evaluation

- LP â€“ albuminocytologic dissociation = high protein with normal cell
    count

    - One exception is HIV, which can cause AIDP but also have a high cell
        count and high protein count

- EMG/NCS

    - Demyelinating pattern (temporal dispersion and decreased conduction
        velocities).

    - **This can be normal in the first few days, and is most useful 2+
        weeks out if the diagnosis is still unclear**

- Differential diagnosis: spinal cord lesions, LEMS, MG, acute HIV or
    HCV, viral myelitis (entero/West Nile)

## Management

- ABCs! NIF at baseline then Q4-6 hours

    - NIF \< -30 with good effort generally warrants ICU monitoring

- IVIG or PLEX

- Can get worse with steroids
