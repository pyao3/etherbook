## Medication Overview:

- Abortive

    - Triptans (e.g. sumatriptan or rizatriptan)

        - Cannot be used more than 10 days/month

        - Avoid in pts with hypertension/CAD

- Preventative

    - Amitriptyline: indicated for both migraine and tension-type. Helps
        with sleep and comorbid depression. Most common side effects (SE) =
        dry mouth, sedation

    - Topiramate: has the best evidence among migraine meds. Can
        theoretically help with weight loss. Most common SE = sodas taste
        bad, sedation, parasthesias

    - Propranolol: useful for relative lack of interactions. Mild
        cardiac/blood pressure effects compared to other beta-blockers. Most
        common SE = drowsiness

    - Magnesium oxide: reduces headache frequency with almost no SE. Start
        400mg daily, can go up to 800mg BID. Patients can increase dose
        until they get diarrhea.

    - Riboflavin (vitamin B2): mild effect but effectively has no side
        effects. 400mg daily.

    - Gabapentin: can be useful if HAs have stabbing/electric quality.
        Main SE = sedation

    - Venlafaxine: useful for migraines with significant vestibular
        symptoms (dizziness). SE = hypertension/tachycardia.

    - Verapamil: can be used for migraine and cluster headaches. Can use
        ER formulation

    - Botox: can be administered every 3 months. Can be very effective,
        but pts generally will have had to fail multiple medications for
        insurance to approve refer to neuro resident clinic

    - CGRP receptor modulators (mostly injections) such as Rimegepant are
        newer options
