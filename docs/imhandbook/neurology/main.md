Neurologic Emergencies

Stroke

Background

- Preferred term: Stroke (CVA is like saying heart attack instead of
    STEMI)

- Sudden onset, focal (usually one-sided) neurologic deficits:
    weakness, sensory loss, vision loss, ataxia/unsteadiness, vertigo,
    double vision, facial droop, dysarthria, aphasia

- Differential:

<!-- -->

- stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic)

- seizure or post-ictal paralysis

- headache phenomena (complex migraine)

- cervical spinal cord lesions, though these more commonly cause
    bilateral symptoms

<!-- -->

- Stroke-like symptoms can also develop as recrudescence – previous
    stroke or brain lesion symptoms worsening with systemic
    toxic/metabolic/infectious processes or hypotension

Evaluation

- Critical decision-making information: last known normal (LKN), time
    symptoms first observed, anticoagulation status, recent surgeries,
    history of bleeding (severe GIB or ICH), recent medications,
    platelet count, and baseline neuro exam

- If symptoms developed with LKN within 24 hours -\> stroke alert!

- **If \> 24 hours, can request Neuroalert Instead**

<!-- -->

- VUMC: call 11111 and tell the operator stroke alert and current
    patient location

- NAVA: call an RRT and stat page 835-5137, include in the page 911 at
    the end of the call back number to signal it is a stroke alert

<!-- -->

- Stat head CTP (order CTH/CTA) for consideration of tPA or
    endovascular therapy

<!-- -->

- If renal function is abnormal, discuss with neurology

- Generally, go for CTA if the patient is a thrombectomy candidate
    **(within 24 hrs of onset)**

- MRI/MRA is an option but takes longer (MRAs are also better with
    Gadolinium)

- Neurology service should be leading this portion

Management

- Blood pressure goals

<!-- -->

- Ischemic stroke:

    - In general aim for SBP \<220

    - Patients with intracranial atherosclerosis may require higher BP
        to maintain perfusion

- Hemorrhagic stroke:

    - SBP \< 140 (BP management is key)

    - These pts are managed in Neuro ICU

    - Reverse coagulopathies and keep platelets \>100,000

Status Epilepticus

Background

- Either a single seizure \>5 minutes or ≥2 seizures occurring without
    a return to baseline in between

- Differentiating convulsive seizures from non-epileptic events
    (“pseudoseizure”):

<!-- -->

- Features that suggest non-epileptic/psychogenic event include
    moaning or talking throughout the event, “no-no” head shake,
    repetitive movements of opposing muscle groups, very arrhythmic or
    purposeful-looking movements, or seizures that have been ongoing for
    “hours”

Evaluation

- Fingerstick glucose, BMP/CBC, and UDS

- Consult Neurology

- EEG (start with 2hr) to determine if it is seizure or not and for
    titration of medications

- Consider a non-contrasted head CT; MRI cannot be obtained while EEG
    is attached

- Up to half of pts presenting in status epilepticus have no history
    of seizure, so they need urgent head imaging, consideration for
    lumbar puncture, infectious and toxic workup, tox screen, and
    sometimes rheumatologic or paraneoplastic workup

- If Hx of seizure or on Antiseizure meds (ASMs) please order trough
    levels

Management

- ABCs! Start with benzos:

<!-- -->

- 2 mg lorazepam IV then repeat q1-3 minutes up to 0.1 mg/kg OR

- 5 mg of diazepam IV every minute (takes longer to give diazepam so
    would give concurrent ASM)

- 10 mg IM midazolam if no IV access

<!-- -->

- After 2 rounds of benzos, would shift to antiepileptics if still in
    status (neurology should be contacted here if not already):

<!-- -->

- IV fosphenytoin 20 mg/kg

- IV levetiracetam 30-60 mg/kg **(generally 3g, up to 4.5g max)**

- IV valproic acid 30 mg/kg

<!-- -->

- If still seizing at this point, the patient will likely need
    intubation

- These pts MUST be placed on EEG if they get paralyzed or sedated
    because convulsive status often continues as nonconvulsive status,
    which still damages the brain!

<!-- -->

- If still seizing, patients should be on midazolam, propofol or
    barbiturate infusions

- Focal seizures, such as arm or face twitching with retained
    awareness do not always need to be treated to the point of
    initiating coma

Myasthenia Gravis (MG) and Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS)

Background

- Disorders of the neuromuscular junction

- MG affects the post-synaptic cleft at the acetylcholine receptor

- LEMS affects the pre-synaptic cleft at the calcium channels

<!-- -->

- Many cases are paraneoplastic (classically small cell lung
    carcinoma)

Presentation

- Double vision, ptosis, dysarthria, dysphagia

- Dyspnea looks different than in other conditions: air hunger,
    usually also with dysphagia

- Initially, the patient may not look sick or distressed, but may have
    a short inspiratory time or difficulty speaking in complete
    sentences due to shallow breathing

- Most pts have a known history of myasthenia, but up to 20% present
    initially with crisis

Evaluation

- Exam

<!-- -->

- Look closely for ptosis, nasal speech, weak neck flexion/extension
    (same nerve roots as diaphragm), interrupted speech to take extra
    breaths

- These patients do not exhibit “huffing and puffing” like in
    COPD/asthma exacerbations

    - Patients with NMJ disease can go from talking to intubated
        within several hours!

- LEMS: less ocular weakness, but do have extremity weakness and
    absent reflexes.

- Pulmonary compromise is very rare in LEMS

<!-- -->

- EMG/NCS

<!-- -->

- MG: decremental response to repetitive stimulation

- LEMS: increased amplitude in response to repetitive stimulation

<!-- -->

- Labs

<!-- -->

- Myasthenia antibody panels (send prior to IVIG/PLEX being given)

<!-- -->

- Imaging

<!-- -->

- Consider chest CT to look for thymic hyperplasia

Management

- Monitor NIF (negative inspiratory force) at baseline and q4h

<!-- -->

- Measure of diaphragmatic strength

- Normal is \<-60

- If below -30, consider elective intubation

- Note that patient effort will affect NIF values

<!-- -->

- IVIG or PLEX

<!-- -->

- Both have similar supportive evidence; IVIG is usually easier to do

- PLEX has the risks you would expect with dialysis (e.g. fluid
    shifts) and coagulopathy

- IVIG -\> check IgA levels. Can increase risk of DVT, has risk of
    aseptic meningitis and provides significant fluid load so not ideal
    for pts with CHF

<!-- -->

- Steroids

<!-- -->

- Usually up-titrated SLOWLY (by 10-20 mg prednisone daily)

- Rapid increases in steroids can worsen patients with MG**, so talk
    to neuro before adjusting**

<!-- -->

- Pyridostigmine

<!-- -->

- Typically continue at their home dose

- Too much pyridostigmine can make patients worse (more secretions),
    so for those doing poorly on \>90 mg per dose, consider lowering the
    dose

<!-- -->

- Treat underlying causes of exacerbations: usually infections or
    other toxic/metabolic insults

- Remove/avoid exacerbating medications: fluoroquinolones,
    aminoglycosides, beta blockers, and magnesium

- LEMS specific management:

<!-- -->

- 3,4-diaminopyridine

- Can respond to IVIG or pyridostigmine

- **Workup for underlying neoplasm**

Acute Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (AIDP)

Background

- Rapid onset polyneuropathy that manifests most often with ascending
    weakness and numbness that can involve the respiratory and facial
    musculature

- Usually preceded by infectious illness a few weeks prior

- **Patients are much more likely to get AIDP from an infection than
    any vaccine, weak vaccine links to AIDP are an addition 1-2 cases
    per million flu vaccines.**

Presentation

- Acute, progressive extremity weakness, weak or absent reflexes, and
    potentially subjective sensatory changes, especially back pain

<!-- -->

- There are a TON of variants of AIDP, with some having cranial nerve
    weakness early, proximal weakness, sensory ataxia, primarily sensory
    loss, or rapid muscle weakness; do not use lack of classic ascending
    weakness to dismiss the idea of AIDP

- Sensory loss is common in an ascending pattern too

Evaluation

- LP – albuminocytologic dissociation = high protein with normal cell
    count

<!-- -->

- One exception is HIV, which can cause AIDP but also have a high cell
    count and high protein count

<!-- -->

- EMG/NCS

<!-- -->

- Demyelinating pattern (temporal dispersion and decreased conduction
    velocities).

- **This can be normal in the first few days, and is most useful 2+
    weeks out if the diagnosis is still unclear**

<!-- -->

- Differential diagnosis: spinal cord lesions, LEMS, MG, acute HIV or
    HCV, viral myelitis (entero/West Nile)

Management

- ABCs! NIF at baseline then Q4-6 hours

<!-- -->

- NIF \< -30 with good effort generally warrants ICU monitoring

<!-- -->

- IVIG or PLEX

- Can get worse with steroids

Elevated Intracranial Pressure (ICP) and Hydrocephalus

Background

- Communicating hydrocephalus (i.e. non-obstructive)

<!-- -->

- Causes: subarachnoid granule scarring after subarachnoid hemorrhage
    or meningitis, ependymoma producing excess CSF, venous sinus
    thrombosis

<!-- -->

- Non-communicating hydrocephalus (i.e. obstructive)

<!-- -->

- Causes: tumor, abscess, or hematoma in the midline ventricular
    structures

<!-- -->

- Eventually, elevated ICP will cause brain herniation

Presentation

- Headache, blurred vision, visual field reduction, enlarged blind
    spot, nausea, vomiting, syncope, coma

- Sixth nerve palsies are common

- Third nerve palsies **(blown pupil)** are classically associated
    with uncal herniation

Evaluation

- Good visual exam: visual fields, enlarged blind spot, papilledema
    (may not be present if very rapid ICP increase, even with vision
    loss), and 6th nerve palsies

- Stat head CT to look for obstructions, mass lesions

<!-- -->

- NSGY evaluation if obstructive lesion (removal vs ventricular drain)

<!-- -->

- CTV or MRV to look for venous sinus thrombosis

<!-- -->

- Venous sinus thrombosis needs AC, even if there is some degree of
    hemorrhagic infarction

<!-- -->

- If no obstructive lesion LP with opening pressure

<!-- -->

- If workup is otherwise normal, except for elevated opening pressure
    diagnosis = IIH

Management

- Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH)

<!-- -->

- Diamox and/or topiramate

- Ophthalmology evaluation emergently for consideration of nerve
    sheath fenestrations or urgent VPS placement if severe disc edema

- If there is clinical concern for herniation:

    - Mannitol: 50g IV, can be given peripherally. Has risks of renal
        injury

    - Hypertonic saline: 3%, 7% or 23% saline can be given, needs
        central access

    - Maintain head of bed at least 30° and loosen neck obstructions
        (c-collars) as able

    - NSGY consult for shunt consideration

- Hyperventilation can be done with goal PaCO2 30-34 mm Hg or ETCO2
    20-30 mmHg but is only a temporizing measure **and risks rebound
    edema**

    - After 4-6 hrs, compensatory pH changes in the blood prevent
        vasoconstrictive affects

Common Neurologic Problems

Altered Mental Status (AMS)

Background

- Definition: Change in a patient’s baseline cognition

<!-- -->

- Can be hypoactive (lethargic) or hyperactive (agitated)

<!-- -->

- Risk factors: Functional impairment, age \> 75, dementia,
    depression, ETOH/substance use disorder, sensory impairment, recent
    surgery

Etiologies: Consider MOVE STUPID mnemonic

- Metabolic (Hypo/hypernatremia, Hypercalcemia)

- Oxygen (Hypoxia)

- Vascular (CVA, Bleed, MI, CHF)

- Endocrine (Hypoglycemia, Thyroid, Adrenal)

- Seizure (postictal state)

- Trauma

- Uremia

- Psychiatric

- Infection

- Drugs – intoxication, withdrawal, or medications

- Delirium – see “Delirium” section in psychiatry

Evaluation

- Consider broad toxic, metabolic, and infectious workup as
    appropriate

<!-- -->

- TSH, Vitamin B12, CBC, CMP, UA, CXR, VBG, blood Cx, glucose, UDS

<!-- -->

- Review of medications

<!-- -->

- Sedatives, anticholinergics, benzos/EtOH toxicity or withdrawal

<!-- -->

- Head imaging in the setting of focal neurologic findings

<!-- -->

- Start with head CT – note strokes take up to 24 hours to show up on
    CT

- Consider MRI if high concern for stroke, inflammatory changes or
    infection

<!-- -->

- LP should be performed if there is any concern for meningitis

- EEG is reasonable with fluctuating mental status or seizure-like
    activity

Management

- First line: nonpharmacologic interventions: HOMMEEESS

<!-- -->

- Hydration/nutrition: ensure patient fed, rule out constipation and
    urinary retention

- Orientation

- Mobilize out of bed 3x/daily as able

- Manage pain

- Eliminate unnecessary devices (restraints, catheters, tele, lines)
    and meds

- Environmental modification: minimize devices, lights on/windows open
    during day

- Engage family

- Sensory restoration: use eyeglasses and hearing aids and reorient

- Sleep protocol: minimize nighttime vitals, earplugs, sleep mask and
    no TV at night

<!-- -->

- Second line: Pharmacologic approaches, see "Delirium" in section in
    psychiatry

Seizure without Status Epilepticus

Background

- Risk factors: birth trauma, prematurity, TBI with loss of awareness
    \> 1 hours or penetrating wound, strokes/tumors/abscesses, history
    of meningitis/encephalitis

- Key for seizures: stereotyped event with sudden onset/offset

<!-- -->

- Generally, if full body systems are involved (e.g., jerking or tonic
    activity), then there will also be loss of awareness

Evaluation

- A clear description or recording of seizure semiology is helpful

- Provoked seizures can develop with medications, hypo/hyperglycemia,
    significant electrolyte abnormalities (e.g. hyponatremia), and CNS
    infections

- EEG is necessary for spell capture

- MRI brain with and without contrast once stable

Non-Epileptic Spells (aka PNES, psychogenic non-epileptic spells)

- Can be very difficult to distinguish from epileptic seizures

- Features more common in PNES

<!-- -->

- Retained awareness with bilateral extremity “seizing”

- Opisthotonus (arching the back)

- Talking during a spell

- Excessively long spells (e.g. lasts hour or days)

- Forced eye closure

- Coachability during a spell or reacting to external stimuli

- Heavy breathing during a spell with lots of rigorous movement

- Immediately returning to normal after a spell

<!-- -->

- Features more common in epileptic seizures:

<!-- -->

- Seizures arising out of sleep

- Highly stereotyped

- Incontinence

- Severe injuries (e.g. burns)

<!-- -->

- Management

<!-- -->

- Try to avoid excessive BZD use

- This requires good clinical judgement as you wouldn't want to
    withhold Ativan and discover that the pt was having true atypical
    seizures. The compromise would be: do not repeatedly administer BZDs
    when there is suspicion for PNES as well as no evidence of response
    to prior BZD administration.

Syncopal Convulsions

- Very common, can present with posturing and tonic-clonic movements
    happening for a few moments after syncope

<!-- -->

- Should not last for more than 30 seconds

- These are just related to syncope and do not typically require
    seizure medications

- Workup:

    - Two-hour EEG and MRI (with and without contrast)

    - Infectious workup, BMP, CBC, blood glucose, toxicology/drug
        screen

    - If there is concern for convulsive syncope, (carefully) check
        orthostatic vitals

Inpatient Headache (HA)

Background

- Important to distinguish primary and secondary headache

- Red flags for secondary headaches (SNOOPP): Systemic symptoms,
    Neurologic symptoms, Onset that is sudden (thunderclap), Older age
    (new headache \>40), Progression or evolution in previous headaches,
    Postural component

- Other red flags: preceding trauma, headache awakening patient from
    sleep, no headache-free intervals, thunderclap headache (maximal
    intensity develops within 11 minutes or less)

Evaluation

- Get a good description of where the pain is, when, associated
    symptoms, and assess for “red flag” features listed above

- If there are any red flag features imaging and workup are necessary

- Imaging depends on highest suspicions, but CTA head/neck is
    appropriate to evaluate for aneurysm (including neck to consider
    dissection). If any focal signs, MRI is generally preferred; venous
    imaging can be beneficial in headaches with features of elevated ICP

- If no red flag features, then workup is not necessary, and focus is
    on treatment

Management

- NSAIDs and Tylenol for infrequent headaches, but consistent use
    (\>2-3 a week) runs the risk of rebound headaches

- Triptans for migraine, but contraindicated in patients with CAD,
    uncontrolled HTN, previous stroke. They must be used within 6 hour
    of onset

<!-- -->

- There are theoretical concerns of serotonin syndrome when used with
    SSRI/SNRIs

<!-- -->

- Migraines:

<!-- -->

- “Migraine cocktail”: 1L fluid bolus, 4g Mg, IV Compazine(10mg) OR
    Phenergan(20mg) with Benadryl (25mg)

- 2<sup>nd</sup> line: Depakote 1000 mg IV, decadron 10mg IV , +/-
    toradol 30mg IV, flexeril 10mg PO

<!-- -->

- Cluster headache:

<!-- -->

- Triptans, high flow O2 (\>10 L), sometimes intranasal lidocaine if
    no arrhythmia history

Medication Overview:

- Abortive

<!-- -->

- Triptans (e.g. sumatriptan or rizatriptan)

    - Cannot be used more than 10 days/month

    - Avoid in pts with hypertension/CAD

<!-- -->

- Preventative

<!-- -->

- Amitriptyline: indicated for both migraine and tension-type. Helps
    with sleep and comorbid depression. Most common side effects (SE) =
    dry mouth, sedation

- Topiramate: has the best evidence among migraine meds. Can
    theoretically help with weight loss. Most common SE = sodas taste
    bad, sedation, parasthesias

- Propranolol: useful for relative lack of interactions. Mild
    cardiac/blood pressure effects compared to other beta-blockers. Most
    common SE = drowsiness

- Magnesium oxide: reduces headache frequency with almost no SE. Start
    400mg daily, can go up to 800mg BID. Patients can increase dose
    until they get diarrhea.

- Riboflavin (vitamin B2): mild effect but effectively has no side
    effects. 400mg daily.

- Gabapentin: can be useful if HAs have stabbing/electric quality.
    Main SE = sedation

- Venlafaxine: useful for migraines with significant vestibular
    symptoms (dizziness). SE = hypertension/tachycardia.

- Verapamil: can be used for migraine and cluster headaches. Can use
    ER formulation

- Botox: can be administered every 3 months. Can be very effective,
    but pts generally will have had to fail multiple medications for
    insurance to approve refer to neuro resident clinic

- CGRP receptor modulators (mostly injections) such as Rimegepant are
    newer options

Parkinson’s Disease

Clinical Presentation

- Resting tremor is typically a very early symptom, often worse on one
    side

- Cogwheel rigidity; can be confused for paratonia, which is seen in
    demented or encephalopathic patients who have involuntary variable
    resistance movements during passive ROM assessment

- Speech changes (low volume), hand-writing changes (slow small
    movements)

- Gait changes

<!-- -->

- Festination – slow start with movements that gradually build up
    speed

- En bloc turning – taking multiple steps to turn around

<!-- -->

- Anosmia and REM behavior sleep disorders are very common

Evaluation

- Clinical diagnosis; there are some supportive imaging studies like
    DaTscan that looks for activity of substantia nigra (usually not
    necessary)

- Clinical response to dopamine replacement is so typical that if a
    patient does not respond, it is important to consider a Parkinson
    plus syndrome (see below)

Management

- Dopamine replacement – carbidopa/levodopa; dosed at regular
    intervals several times a day. These generally do not need to be
    held on admission.

<!-- -->

- If pt is altered, can hold anticholinergics, MAO-B inhibitors or
    COMT inhibitors

<!-- -->

- Dopamine agonists – can cause confusion, hallucinations, dyskinesias

- MAO-B inhibitors (MAOIs): can cause confusion, hallucinations,
    insomnia and dyskinesias

- COMT inhibitors – can cause confusion, hallucinations, insomnia, and
    dyskinesias

- Anticholinergics – useful for tremor when there is not much
    bradykinesia or gait disturbances. In older pts cognitive changes
    are a bigger concern along with hallucinations

- PD medications are rarely titrated in the hospital because acute
    medical illness makes PD symptoms worse and everything will need to
    be re-adjusted as an outpatient

- Be cautious with PRN anti-emetics in patients with PD. Many work via
    dopamine antagonism. Zofran is generally the safest option.

- Similarly, many antipsychotics have dopamine antagonism. Safest
    option is seroquel

Parkinson Plus Syndromes

Evaluation

- Consider if atypical features such as bilateral symmetric onset,
    early cognitive/personality changes, cerebellar findings, or
    prominent autonomic dysfunction early

Types

- Progressive Supranuclear Palsy

<!-- -->

- PD symptoms with early falls and minimal tremor

- Vertical eye movement abnormalities

<!-- -->

- Multisystem Atrophy

<!-- -->

- Profound orthostatic hypotension without any increase in HR

- Three types:

    - MSA-A – autonomic features prominent (previously Shy-Drager
        Syndrome)

    - MSA-P – prominent atypical Parkinsonism features

    - MSA-C – prominent cerebellar dysfunction

<!-- -->

- Lewy Body Dementia

<!-- -->

- Parkinsonism with prominent early cognitive impairment and
    hallucinations

Brain Masses

Background

- Neoplasm is the biggest concern

<!-- -->

- 90% of malignant brain masses are metastatic

    - Most commonly: lung, RCC, breast, melanoma

    - Highest bleeding risk: melanoma, thyroid, choriocarcinoma, RCC

- Primary brain tumors

    - Gliomas: WHO Grade I-IV

        - Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) – WHO Grade IV; large
            heterogenous masses with edema; heterogenous contrast
            enhancement; can cross the corpus callosum

        - Lower grade gliomas – include oligodendrogliomas and
            astrocytomas

    - Meningioma: usually low grade

        - Can be left alone and monitored with yearly MRI

        - If symptomatic, may need resection/radiation

    - Ependymoma: uncommon. Can cause CSF outflow obstruction

    - CNS lymphoma – diffuse WM involvement, with mass effect,
        restricts diffusion on MRI with prominent contrast enhancement.
        Can also cross the corpus callosum

        - Usually B-cell, initially responds significantly to steroids

Presentation

- A significant number of brain lesions are detected incidentally

- If a patient has a first-time seizure, brain mass needs to be ruled
    out

- HA (usually constant, severe), seizure, and focal neurologic
    deficits

Evaluation/Management

- Imaging: MRI w/ and w/o contrast provides the most information

<!-- -->

- Findings suggesting malignant lesions: marked edema, multifocal
    lesions, or presence at gray-white junctions

<!-- -->

- LP may be indicated if herniation risk is low, particularly if
    concerned for infection

- Biopsy will ultimately be needed in most cases, which is done by
    NSGY

Management

- Work up for primary malignancy, CT C/A/P + PET

- Steroids are generally indicated for treatment of edema

<!-- -->

- Decadron 10 mg IV to start; then transition to 4mg IV q6h with SSI

<!-- -->

- Symptomatic tumors need eval by NSGY for resection consideration and
    radiation oncology

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)

Background

- Progressive weakness, often asymmetric and profound with no sensory
    loss

- Combination of LMN and UMN findings

<!-- -->

- LMN findings: weakness, flaccidity, absent/decreased reflexes,
    fasciculations

- UMN findings: weakness, spasticity, hyperreflexia, pathologic
    reflexes (e.g. extensor plantar response), slow movements

<!-- -->

- Pts with bulbar symptoms may complain of difficulty swallowing,
    changes in their voice, or increased saliva production (they just
    aren’t swallowing it)

- Tongue fasciculations are fairly uncommon in other disorders and is
    a good clue for ALS if present (these can be hard to be certain of –
    tongue movements that are symmetric are typically not
    fasciculations)

- Pseudobulbar affect – inappropriate laughing or crying; relatively
    common in ALS

- FVC is an important marker for function

Evaluation

- EMG/NCS is gold standard; El Escorial Criteria looks for evidence of
    UMN and LMN findings at cranial, cervical, thoracic and lumbosacral
    levels to determine if ALS or not

- Exclude mimicking lesions, which may be treatable (see below)

Management

- Patients with ALS are ideally treated with a multidisciplinary team
    of Neurologists, Pulmonologists, Speech therapists, PT, OT and
    mobility

- Two medications have been shown to add a few months to survival:

<!-- -->

- Riluzole - PO med; have to track CBC/LFTs. Side effects: GI and
    general weakness

- Edaravone (Radicava) – IV, given daily for 2 weeks every month. SE =
    HA, bruising

Mimics of ALS

- High cervical spine lesions –UMN changes in upper extremity with LMN
    pattern in LE

- Primary Lateral Sclerosis – UMN-only disease, much less common with
    much slower progression. Many transition to ALS in the first 1-2
    years, which then is likely a spectrum of the same disease

- Multifocal Motor Neuropathy – rare autoimmune disorder that looks
    like ALS with LMN signs only, responds to IVIG. Can have anti-GM1 Ab
    in blood. EMG/NCS pattern is different with conduction block

- Kennedy Disease – X-linked genetic disorder with progressive LMN
    pattern of weakness and endocrine disorders w/androgen resistance
    profile (gynecomastia, defective spermatogenesis)

- Inclusion Body Myositis – can be asymmetric with grip weakness and
    quadriceps weakness. Biopsy and atrophy pattern usually
    distinguishes it. CPK 500-800.

- Polymyositis/dermatomyositis – proximal weakness in arms/legs, CPK
    \> 1000, usually younger onset (30-40s), no UMN signs

Multiple Sclerosis

Background

- Progressive inflammatory disorder primarily manifesting with
    demyelination of the central white matter

- Optic neuritis and transverse myelitis (spinal cord lesion) are
    common presentations

- Generally develop over a few days; very uncommon to happen suddenly
    (e.g., patients will complain about a dark spot appearing in their
    vision that expands over several days)

Evaluation

- MRI w/ and w/o contrast can identify plaques and determine if they
    are more acute

<!-- -->

- “Active” MS plaque will enhance, and continues to for weeks (even
    after treatment)

<!-- -->

- Modified MacDonald Criteria: ≥3 characteristic demyelinating lesions
    (\>1 cm, periventricular, infratentorial (brainstem/cerebellum/cord)
    or juxtacortical in location) with evidence of separation in time
    (active and chronic)

- LP with studies for oligoclonal bands, IgG index, cell count and
    protein, anti-mog, anti-aqp4

Management

- Treat flares and optic neuritis with steroids

<!-- -->

- Speeds up recovery, but does not improve the degree of recovery

- Often dosing starts with methylpred 1g

<!-- -->

- If a patient with known MS has worsening symptoms that are not new,
    then recrudescence is the likely cause infectious/toxic/metabolic
    workup and imaging is needed

- There are several long-term medications; common side effects listed
    below:

<!-- -->

- Interferon (SQ injections) – flu-like symptoms, injection site
    reactions

- Glatiramer acetate (SQ) – injection site reactions

- Fingolimod (PO) – macular edema, liver injury, increased risk of
    skin cancer

- Teriflunomide (PO) – liver injury, hair loss, immunosuppression,
    teratogenic

- Dimethyl fumarate (PO) – GI side effects, lymphocytopenia, liver
    injury

- Natalizumab (IV) – PML concern, immunosuppression

- Ocrelizumab (IV) – contraindicated in active HBV infection, cannot
    give live vaccines

- Alemtuzumab (IV) – autoimmune disease, rash, headache

Neuromyelitis Optica and Spectrum Disorder

- Demyelinating disease due to Ab against aquaporin-4 (on
    oligodendrocytes)

- Classically causes optic neuritis and longitudinally extensive
    transverse myelitis

<!-- -->

- Can be more aggressive than MS

<!-- -->

- Diagnose with NMO antibodies and MS workup as above

- Treated with steroids, but in severe or refractory cases may require
    PLEX

Vertigo

Background

- Clinical Presentation

<!-- -->

- Sensation of the room spinning or moving, or themselves spinning or
    moving

- Must distinguish from orthostasis/presyncope via history

<!-- -->

- Causes: most easily differentiated based on chronicity and triggers
    rather than description of symptoms

<!-- -->

- BPPV - short duration, very positional, classically nystagmus is
    horizontal and torsional with the posterior canal being most
    commonly involved

- Vestibular neuronitis/labyrinthitis – typically follows URI or ear
    infections; often self-limited, but can be severe/prolonged, in
    which case it is treated with steroids

- Menière’s Disease – tinnitus and low range frequency hearing loss,
    generally progressive and treated with diuretics, meclizine and
    sometimes surgeries or intratympanic injections

- Endolymphatic Leak – usually following trauma or concussive blasts,
    requires ENT eval and management. Classically a loud sound will
    cause vertigo and nystagmus

- vertiginous migraine: usual migraine triggers, may have aura.
    Episodic nature and often positive family hx of migraine or even
    vertiginous migraine.

- Stroke – sudden onset, ask about vascular risk factors, rare cause
    of isolated vertigo

Evaluation/Management

- Careful exam of vertigo will be more helpful than random scans, but
    pt has to be symptomatic for exam to mean anything:

<!-- -->

- HINTS Battery – Head Impulse test, Nystagmus pattern, Test of skew

    - Central pattern – no corrective saccade, multidirectional
        nystagmus, skew present

    - Peripheral pattern – corrective saccade, unidirectional
        nystagmus, no skew present

- Dix-Hallpike Test

- Cerebellar testing: FNF, HKS, mirroring, gait

- Outpatient Vestibular function testing with ENT

<!-- -->

- Central patterns will need head and vessel imaging (looking for
    vertebral dissection or basilar clots)

<!-- -->

- Often, central vertigo is due to centrally acting medications

<!-- -->

- Peripheral causes are varied and often require eval by ENT as an
    outpatient

- Treatment with anticholinergics like meclizine or scopolamine is
    often helpful

- Vestibular therapy with OT is also very beneficial
