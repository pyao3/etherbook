# Altered Mental Status (AMS)

## Background

- Definition: Change in a patient’s baseline cognition

    - Can be hypoactive (lethargic) or hyperactive (agitated)

- Risk factors: Functional impairment, age \> 75, dementia,
    depression, ETOH/substance use disorder, sensory impairment, recent
    surgery

## Etiologies: Consider MOVE STUPID mnemonic

   - Metabolic (Hypo/hypernatremia, Hypercalcemia)

   - Oxygen (Hypoxia)

   - Vascular (CVA, Bleed, MI, CHF)

   - Endocrine (Hypoglycemia, Thyroid, Adrenal)

   - Seizure (postictal state)

   - Trauma

   - Uremia

   - Psychiatric

   - Infection

   - Drugs – intoxication, withdrawal, or medications

   - Delirium – see “Delirium” section in psychiatry

## Evaluation

- Consider broad toxic, metabolic, and infectious workup as
    appropriate

    - TSH, Vitamin B12, CBC, CMP, UA, CXR, VBG, blood Cx, glucose, UDS


- Review of medications

    - Sedatives, anticholinergics, benzos/EtOH toxicity or withdrawal

- Head imaging in the setting of focal neurologic findings

    - Start with head CT – note strokes take up to 24 hours to show up on
        CT

    - Consider MRI if high concern for stroke, inflammatory changes or
        infection

- LP should be performed if there is any concern for meningitis

- EEG is reasonable with fluctuating mental status or seizure-like
    activity

## Management

- Management of underlying etiology 

- See "Delirium" in section in psychiatry for nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management
