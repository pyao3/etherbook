# Brain Masses

## Background

- Neoplasm is the biggest concern

    - 90% of malignant brain masses are metastatic

        - Most commonly: lung, RCC, breast, melanoma

        - Highest bleeding risk: melanoma, thyroid, choriocarcinoma, RCC

    - Primary brain tumors

        - Gliomas: WHO Grade I-IV

            - Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) – WHO Grade IV; large
                heterogenous masses with edema; heterogenous contrast
                enhancement; can cross the corpus callosum

            - Lower grade gliomas – include oligodendrogliomas and
                astrocytomas

        - Meningioma: usually low grade

            - Can be left alone and monitored with yearly MRI

            - If symptomatic, may need resection/radiation

        - Ependymoma: uncommon. Can cause CSF outflow obstruction

        - CNS lymphoma – diffuse WM involvement, with mass effect,
            restricts diffusion on MRI with prominent contrast enhancement.
            Can also cross the corpus callosum

            - Usually B-cell, initially responds significantly to steroids

## Presentation

- A significant number of brain lesions are detected incidentally

- If a patient has a first-time seizure, brain mass needs to be ruled
    out

- HA (usually constant, severe), seizure, and focal neurologic
    deficits

## Evaluation/Management

- Imaging: MRI w/ and w/o contrast provides the most information

    - Findings suggesting malignant lesions: marked edema, multifocal
        lesions, or presence at gray-white junctions

- LP may be indicated if herniation risk is low, particularly if
    concerned for infection

- Biopsy will ultimately be needed in most cases, which is done by
    NSGY

## Management

- Work up for primary malignancy, CT C/A/P + PET

- Steroids are generally indicated for treatment of edema

    - Decadron 10 mg IV to start; then transition to 4mg IV q6h with SSI

- Symptomatic tumors need eval by NSGY for resection consideration and
    radiation oncology
