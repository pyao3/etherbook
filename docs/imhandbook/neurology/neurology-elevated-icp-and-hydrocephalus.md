# Elevated Intracranial Pressure (ICP) and Hydrocephalus

## Background

- Communicating hydrocephalus (i.e. non-obstructive)

    - Causes: subarachnoid granule scarring after subarachnoid hemorrhage
        or meningitis, ependymoma producing excess CSF, venous sinus
        thrombosis

- Non-communicating hydrocephalus (i.e. obstructive)

    - Causes: tumor, abscess, or hematoma in the midline ventricular
        structures

- Eventually, elevated ICP will cause brain herniation

## Presentation

- Headache, blurred vision, visual field reduction, enlarged blind
    spot, nausea, vomiting, syncope, coma

- Sixth nerve palsies are common

- Third nerve palsies **(blown pupil)** are classically associated
    with uncal herniation

## Evaluation

- Good visual exam: visual fields, enlarged blind spot, papilledema
    (may not be present if very rapid ICP increase, even with vision
    loss), and 6th nerve palsies

- Stat head CT to look for obstructions, mass lesions

    - NSGY evaluation if obstructive lesion (removal vs ventricular drain)

- CTV or MRV to look for venous sinus thrombosis

    - Venous sinus thrombosis needs AC, even if there is some degree of
        hemorrhagic infarction

- If no obstructive lesion LP with opening pressure

    - If workup is otherwise normal, except for elevated opening pressure
        diagnosis = IIH

## Management

- Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH)

    - Diamox and/or topiramate

    - Ophthalmology evaluation emergently for consideration of nerve
        sheath fenestrations or urgent VPS placement if severe disc edema

    - If there is clinical concern for herniation:

        - Mannitol: 50g IV, can be given peripherally. Has risks of renal
            injury

        - Hypertonic saline: 3%, 7% or 23% saline can be given, needs
            central access

        - Maintain head of bed at least 30Â° and loosen neck obstructions
            (c-collars) as able

        - NSGY consult for shunt consideration

    - Hyperventilation can be done with goal PaCO2 30-34 mm Hg or ETCO2
        20-30 mmHg but is only a temporizing measure **and risks rebound
        edema**

        - After 4-6 hrs, compensatory pH changes in the blood prevent
            vasoconstrictive affects
