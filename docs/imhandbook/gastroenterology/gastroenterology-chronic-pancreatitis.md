# Chronic Pancreatitis

## Definition

A syndrome characterized by irreversible chronic progressive
pancreatic inflammation, fibrosis, and scarring, resulting in damage to
and loss of exocrine (acinar), endocrine (islet cells), and ductal cells

## Etiology

TIGAR-O mnemonic

- <u>T</u>oxic Metabolic: EtOH, tobacco use, hyperCa (Ca \> 12), HLD
    (fasting TG \> 300, nonfasting \> 500), CKD 5, medications, toxins
- <u>I</u>diopathic: early onset (age \< 35), late onset (age \> 35)
- <u>G</u>enetic: Autosomal dominant (PRSS1 gene), recessive (CFTR,
    SPINK1, etc.)
- <u>A</u>utoimmune: IgG4-related (AIP type 1), AIP type 2
- <u>R</u>ecurrent, severe acute pancreatitis
- <u>O</u>bstructive: pancreas divisum, ampullary stenosis, main duct
    pancreatic stones or strictures, widespread calcifications, mass
    causing duct obstruction

## Presentation

- Abdominal pain (most common)
- Exocrine insufficiency: diarrhea, steatorrhea, weight loss
    - Typically occurs later in disease process
- Endocrine insufficiency: diabetes
- Occasionally asymptomatic

# Evaluation

- Imaging: CT or MRI (may be negative early in course of disease)
    - If CT or MRI negative but suspicion for CP remains high,
        consider EUS +/- biopsy or secretin-enhanced MRCP
- Labs:
    - BMP, LFTs, lipid panel, PeTH
    - Consider genetic testing, especially in younger patients and/or
        patients without clear etiology
    - Pancreatic function testing diagnoses exocrine insufficiency but
        is not necessary for diagnosis of CP
        - Gold standard = 72-hour fecal fat (> 7g of fat per 100g
            stool per day) - rarely done
        - More practical = fecal elastase (<100 = diagnostic, 100-200
            = indeterminate)
            - Must be performed on formed stool, can be false positive
                If watery specimen
            - Do not have to stop pancreatic enzymes to measure
    - Lipase and amylase levels can be elevated, but are usually
        normal due to pancreatic scarring and fibrosis

## Management

- Tobacco and EtOH cessation
- Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy if evidence/diagnosis of
    exocrine insufficiency
    - Usual dose: 50,000 units/meal + 25,000 units with snacks
    - Should take with first bite of a meal and consider adding extra
        enzymes or splitting up dose throughout meal if lasting longer
        than 15 mins
    - If lack of response: try increasing dose, confirm compliance,
        add PPI, split up dose throughout meal, look for concurrent GI
        disorders
- Pain: Tylenol + NSAIDs > Opioids (Tramadol), consider SSRI/SNRI/TCA
    or gabapentin
    - For refractory pain, other options include celiac plexus
        blockade or total pancreatectomy with islet auto transplant
- Vitamin supplementation + Vit D + Ca
- Consider antioxidants (selenium, ascorbic acid, β-carotene, and
    methionine, vitamin E) – mixed evidence but some studies have shown
    improved pain control
- Routine testing for osteoporosis and fat-soluble vitamin
    deficiencies
