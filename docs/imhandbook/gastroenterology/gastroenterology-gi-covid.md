# GI Manifestations of COVID

Taylor Riggs

## Background

- GI manifestations are reported up to 60% of patients with COVID
- GI symptoms may be the only symptom or precede other symptoms
- GI manifestations are felt to be due to expression of ACE2 receptor
    throughout the GI tract

## Presentation

- Diarrhea – more common in severe disease
  - ~20% have diarrhea as first symptom of COVID; on average, lasts
    about 5 days
- Nausea and vomiting – associated with more severe disease
- Mesenteric ischemia – likely due to intestinal microvascular injury
- Elevated liver enzymes – likely due to inflammatory response and
    direct virus-related toxicity
  - Hepatocellular pattern of injury most common; elevated bilirubin
    seen in severe disease
  - Usually self-limited
- Pancreatitis has been reported in several cases, but no causal link
    has been established

## Management

- Largely supportive care
- Monitor LFTs, coags, consider checking lipase if abdominal pain
- If LFTs not improving after several days or underlying chronic liver
    disease, obtain RUQ U/S, consider hepatitis serologies
- Consider medications/antiviral medications as culprit and
    discontinue as indicated
