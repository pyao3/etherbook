# Clostridioides Difficile Infections

Anton de Witte

## Background

- *Clostridioides difficile* is the causative bacteria for
    antibiotic-associated colitis
- Always consider C. diff in a hospitalized patient with unexplained
    leukocytosis
- Microbiology: Anaerobic gram-positive, spore-forming,
    toxin-producing bacillus
- Outside colon, exists in spore form – resistant to heat, acid, and
    antibiotics (why we must wash our hands)
- Spores are transferred from environment to person, once in intestine
    convert to functional vegetative, toxin-producing forms susceptible
    to antibiotics
- To be pathogenic, must release toxin (A+B) to cause colitis and
    diarrhea
- Risk Factors: Antibiotic use (during use or typically up to 1 month
    after use), age \>65, hospitalization, enteral feeding, obesity,
    stem cell transplant, chemo, IBD, cirrhosis, +/- PPI use (no clear
    causal relationship)

## Presentation

- Spectrum from asymptomatic carrier to fulminant colitis with toxic
    megacolon
- Asymptomatic carrier: 20% of hospitalized patients (50% of adults in
    long term care facilities)
- Non-severe disease: watery diarrhea (>3 unformed stools in 24
    hours), lower abdominal pain, nausea, ± fever, leukocytosis (WBC
    >15,000)
- Severe disease: diarrhea, diffuse abdominal pain, abdominal
    distention, fever, lactic acidosis, AKI (Cr > 1.5), marked
    leukocytosis (sometimes >40,000)
- Fulminant disease: Severe criteria + hypotension/shock, ileus
    (rare), or megacolon (>7cm colon diameter and/or >12cm cecum
    diameter)
- Recurrent disease (relapse > reinfection): resolution of symptoms
    on therapy followed by reappearance of symptoms within 2-8 weeks
    after stopping therapy; (Up to 25% of patients have recurrence)
- If symptoms never resolve, consider refractory C. diff or
    alternative diagnosis

## Evaluation

- Stool PCR for toxigenic strains (very sensitive, can detect
    asymptomatic carriers w/o toxin production); with reflex EIA (enzyme
    immunoassay) for toxins A and B (specificity of 99%)
    - PCR (+)/Toxin (-) = carrier
    - PCR (+)/Toxin (+) = treat
    - PCR (-) = no treatment
- Imaging
    - Nonsevere disease: no imaging necessary
    - Severe or fulminant disease: CT a/p with oral and IV contrast
- Endoscopy: Typically used when alternative diagnosis is suspected;
    not warranted for classical symptoms, positive laboratory tests, or
    clinical response to treatment

## Management

- Contact precautions until at least 48 hours after diarrhea resolves
- Classify patient disease severity to guide treatment algorithm
- Do not repeat stool testing – 50% remain positive after treatment up
    to 6 weeks later
