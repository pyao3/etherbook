# Biliary Disease

## Pearls

- ERCP is not available at VA: requires fee-basis consult to VUMC,
    contact GI to arrange
- Prior cholecystectomy CBD normally dilates to 10 mm, not pathologic
- Pneumobilia generally indicates performance of prior biliary
    sphincterotomy and/or biliary stent
- CBD dilation classically \> 6mm, but CBD dilates with age: 70 yo
    7mm, 80 yo 8mm; opiates can also cause biliary dilatation

## Biliary Colic

- Transient biliary obstruction typically at the GB neck without GB
    inflammation (no fever)
- Presentation: Constant (not colicky) intense, dull RUQ pain and N/V
    for 30 minutes to 6 hours, then resolves, provoked by fatty foods
    (CCK), absent Murphy’s sign
- Biliary colic generally consists of discrete episodes separated by
    weeks to months, and not daily pain
- Evaluation: Normal (CBC, LFTs, Lipase, Lactate)
- Imaging: RUQ U/S: cholelithiasis (stones in GB)
- Management: Elective cholecystectomy as outpatient

## Acute Calculous Cholecystitis

- Inflammation of the GB from an obstructing stone in the GB neck or
    cystic duct
- Ddx: PUD, pancreatitis, choledocholithiasis, ascending cholangitis,
    IBD, Fitz-Hugh Curtis
- Presentation: Severe constant RUQ pain, fever/chills, N/V, + Murphy
    sign
- Evaluation: CBC (leukocytosis), CMP (mild AST/ALT ↑), Lipase,
    Lactate, BCx x2
- Imaging: RUQ U/S: gallstones + GB wall thickening or pericholecystic
    edema
    - If U/S non-diagnostic (no stones or GB inflammation) HIDA Scan (lack
    of GB filling)
- Management
    - NPO, IVF, IV Abx until resolved or surgical removal
    - Urgent Cholecystectomy (<72H) with EGS;
    - If poor surgical candidate: Cholecystostomy with IR; endoscopic
    drainage options for selected patients (i.e. poor surgical
    candidates also with ascites)
- Complications: gangrenous cholecystitis, perforation, emphysematous
    cholecystitis, chole-cysto-enteric fistula, gallstone ileus

## Acute Acalculous Cholecystitis

- Inflammation of the GB without obstructing stone (due to stasis and
    ischemia)
- Presentation: Seen in critically ill/ICU pts; similar history as
    above; may present as unexplained fever or RUQ mass (rarely
    jaundice)
- Ddx: calculous cholecystitis, pancreatitis, hepatic abscess
- Evaluation: Same as acute calculous cholecystitis
- Imaging: GB wall thickening, pericholecystic edema, intramural gas,
    GB distention
- Management
    - Supportive care, antibiotics, GB drainage
    - IVF, correct electrolyte abnormalities, NPO
    - Broad spectrum antibiotic coverage
    - Place CT-guided procedure consult for cholecystostomy placement vs
    Endoscopic drainage (transpapillary cystic duct stent via ERCP or
    cholecystoduodenostomy by EUS)
    - Consult EGS if necrosis, perforation, or emphysematous changes
    present
    
## Choledocholithiasis

- Obstruction of biliary outflow by CBD stone without inflammation (no
    fever)
- Impacted cystic duct stone (cholecystitis) with compression of the
    CBD (Mirizzi syndrome)
- Presentation: RUQ pain (can be painless), N/V and jaundice
- Evaluation:
    - CMP and D-bili (Bili/ALP/ GGT ↑↑↑, AST/ALT mild ↑), CBC
    (Leukocytosis suggests cholangitis), Lipase
    - Imaging: RUQ U/S: dilated CBD (ULN is 6mm) MRCP/EUS vs ERCP (see
    below)
        - MRCP preferred given non-invasive but has lower sensitivity for
        smaller stones (consider EUS if still have suspicion despite
        negative MRCP or if patient contraindication to/intolerance of MRI)
- Management:
    - NPO & IVF, pain control PRN
    - Stratify risk to determine whether to pursue MRCP (noninvasive,
    diagnostic) vs ERCP
    - If any one of the following, patient is HIGH risk consult GI for
    > ERCP + EGS to consider cholecystectomy
        - CBD stone on imaging
        - Acute cholangitis
        - Tbili > 4 AND dilated CBD (>6mm with GB, > 8mm without GB)
    - If any one of the following, patient is INTERMEDIATE risk consider
        MRCP (or EUS or cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiogram)
        - Abnormal liver enzymes
        - Age > 55
        - Dilated CBD on U/S with Tbili < 4
        - If CBD stone seen on MRCP or EUS ERCP,
        - If no CBD stone but patient has GB sludge or cholelithiasis EGS
            consult for cholecystectomy + intraoperative cholangiogram

## Acute Cholangitis

- Bacterial infection of biliary tract 2/2 obstruction (typically
    stones) or prior instrumentation (ERCP)
- Pts with malignant obstruction typically do not develop cholangitis
- Presentation: Charcot triad (RUQ pain, fever, jaundice); Reynolds’
    Pentad (AMS, Hypotension)
- Evaluation
    - CBC, CMP (D bili, ALP ↑↑↑) Blood Cultures, Lipase,
    Lactate
    - CRP, AST/ALT can be ↑↑ as well
    - Imaging: RUQ U/S: dilated CBD (ULN is 6mm), no need for MRCP/EUS
    - Consider MRCP overnight if ERCP is not being done emergently
- Management
    - NPO, IVF
    - Consult GI for urgent/emergent ERCP (generally within 24 hr)
    - If ERCP not feasible or fails to establish biliary drainage, can
    consider EUS-guided biliary drainage, percutaneous transhepatic
    cholangiography, or surgical decompression
    - Antibiotics for Biliary Disease (IDSA Guidelines):
        - Mild to moderate acute cholecystitis (stable):
        - Ceftriaxone 2g daily, Cefazolin 1-2g q8H
    - Cholangitis or Severe acute cholecystitis (unstable or
    immunocompromised):
        - Zosyn 3.375g q8H, Meropenem 1g q8H or Cipro 500 q12H and Flagyl
        500 q8H
    - Healthcare-associated Biliary infections: consider Vancomycin
        (order w/ PK consult)
