# Intestinal Ischemia

## Acute Mesenteric Ischemia

- Sudden onset ↓ or absence of blood flow to the small intestines
- Mesenteric Arterial Occlusion:
    - Arterial Embolism: Associated with cardiac arrhythmias (atrial
    fibrillation), valvular disease, endocarditis, ventricular aneurysm,
    aortic atherosclerosis, and aortic aneurysm
    - Arterial thrombosis: Most commonly from atherosclerotic disease; can
    also be 2/2 abdominal trauma, infection, or dissection
- Venous thrombosis:
    - Associated w/ hypercoagulable states, malignancy, prior abdominal
    surgery, abdominal mass venous compression, intra-abdominal
    inflammatory processes
- Non occlusive mesenteric ischemia:
    - Intestinal hypoperfusion and vasoconstriction; associated with
    decreased cardiac output, sepsis, vasopressor use

### Presentation

- Early: Abdominal pain is most common symptom, abdominal distension
- Abdominal tenderness is not prominent early (“pain out of proportion
    to the exam”)
- Arterial occlusion: Sudden onset, severe periumbilical pain, nausea,
    and emesis
- Venous thrombosis: More insidious onset abdominal pain, waxing and
    waning
- Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia: variable location and severity of
    abdominal pain; often overshadowed by a precipitating disorder
- Late: As transmural bowel infarction develops, abdomen becomes
    distended, bowel sounds become absent, and peritoneal signs develop 

### Evaluation

- Type and Screen, Lactic acid, BMP, CBC
- Imaging: KUB: Normal in \> 25% of cases
- Ileus w/ distended bowel loops, bowel wall thickening, ± pneumatosis
    intestinalis
- Free intraperitoneal air immediate abdominal exploration
- CT Angiography: no oral contrast, obscures mesenteric vessels, ↓
    bowel wall enhancement
- Focal or segmental bowel wall thickening, intestinal pneumatosis,
    portal vein gas, porto-mesenteric thrombosis, mesenteric arterial
    calcification, mesenteric artery occlusion

### Management

- General: IVFs, NPO, hemodynamic monitoring and support (try to avoid
    vasoconstricting agents), anticoagulation, broad-spectrum
    antibiotics, pain control
- If develops peritonitis or evidence of perforation on CT EGS consult
    for surgery
- Mesenteric arterial embolism: Embolectomy vs. local infusion of
    thrombolytic agent
- Mesenteric arterial thrombosis: Surgical revascularization vs.
    thrombolysis with endovascular angioplasty and stenting
- Venous thrombosis: Anticoagulation; possible thrombolysis if
    persistent symptoms
- Nonocclusive occlusion: Treat underlying cause, stop
    vasoconstriction meds, consider intra-arterial vasodilator infusion

## Chronic Mesenteric Ischemia

### Background

- ↓ blood flow to intestines, typically caused by atherosclerosis of
    mesenteric vessel
- High-grade mesenteric vascular stenoses in at least two major
    vessels (celiac, SMA, or IMA) must be established

### Presentation

- Recurrent dull, crampy, postprandial abdominal pain
- Pts develop food aversion and often have associated weight loss

### Evaluation

- CTA abdomen/pelvis is preferred (\>90% sensitivity and specificity)
- Can also consider duplex U/S and gastric tonometry

### Management

- Conservative management if asymptomatic: smoking cessation and
    secondary prevention to limit progression of atherosclerotic disease
- Nutritional evaluation
- Revascularization (open vs. endovascular) is indicated if symptoms
    are present
- Mesenteric angioplasty and stenting is first-line therapy
- Goal is to prevent future bowel infarction

## Ischemic Colitis

### Background

- Sudden, transient reduction in blood flow to colon
- Typically at “watershed” areas, such as the splenic flexure and
    rectosigmoid junction
- Most often nonocclusive (95% of cases) and affects older adults
- Risk factors: ACS, hemodialysis, shock, aortoiliac instrumentation,
    cardiopulmonary bypass, extreme exercise (marathon running)

### Presentation

- Rapid onset, mild cramping abdominal pain, associated with urge to
    defecate, hematochezia
- Tenderness present (typically over left side)

### Evaluation

- Lactic acid (nonspecific but elevated), LDH, CPK, CBC
    (leukocytosis), BMP (metabolic acidosis)
- KUB; if peritonitis or signs of severe ischemia → surgery 
- CT A/P with IV contrast (and oral contrast if patient can tolerate)
- Consider CTA A/P if suspicion for vascular occlusion
- Colonoscopy confirms diagnosis. 
- Edematous, friable mucosa; erythema; and interspersed pale areas;
    bluish hemorrhagic nodules representing submucosal bleeding
- Segmental distribution, abrupt transition between injured and
    non-injured mucosa

### Management

General: IVFs, bowel rest, antibiotics (Zosyn vs CTX/flagyl)
