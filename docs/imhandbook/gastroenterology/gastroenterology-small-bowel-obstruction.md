# Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO)

## Background

- Risk Factors: prior abdominal surgeries (adhesions), malignancy,
    hernia, intestinal inflammation (IBD)/stricture, radiation, abscess,
    foreign bodies
- Indicators for bowel ischemia: fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia,
    peritonitis
- Ddx: early appendicitis, large bowel obstruction, Ogilvie’s, DKA,
    Pancreatitis, IBD, Gastric outlet obstruction

## Presentation

- Nausea, emesis, intermittent colic, bloating, constipation
- Obstipation if completely obstructed, loss of flatulence
- Exam: classically with “tinkling” bowel sounds, tympanic abdomen,
    distended abdomen

## Evaluation

- CBC, BMP, lipase, hepatic function panel, lactate (sensitive, not
    specific for ischemia)
- Start with KUB to rule out perforation but typically will require CT
    (x-ray only \~80% sensitive)
- CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast is optimal study if adequate
    renal function
    - No oral contrast (American College of Radiology (ACR)
    Appropriateness Criteria) as it will not aid diagnosis and can lead
    to aspiration; IV helps evaluate ischemia
- Key word: transition point
- Non-specific signs of bowel inflammation: bowel wall thickening,
    submucosal edema

## Management

- Consult EGS: if any concern for SBO, evaluate need for urgent
    surgery
- Surgical indications complete obstruction, CT with ischemia,
    perforation
- Gastric decompression: place NGT (prevent aspiration)
- NPO until obstruction relieved and NGT removed
- Fluids: two large bore IVs (nursing communication); LR bolus +
    maintenance while NPO
- If no resolution of partial obstruction at 48 hours:
- Fluoroscopy Upper GI small bowel ft (follow through)
    - In comments, write “Gastrografin contrast” (water-soluble
        contrast) which osmotically reduces bowel wall edema and aids
        peristalsis
    - If gastrografin reaches the colon within 24 hours, it predicts
        clinical resolution of SBO without surgery
    - Note: this can also be therapeutic for pSBO and get bowels moving
