# Peptic Ulcer Disease

Michelle Izmaylov

---

## Background

- Ulceration in the GI tract wall extending through the muscularis
    mucosa into deeper layers
- Most common in the stomach and proximal duodenum
- Less common in the lower esophagus, the distal duodenum, or the
    jejunum
    - ↑ suspicion for unopposed hypersecretory states, like
        Zollinger-Ellison syndrome
- Causes: NSAID use and Helicobacter pylori \>\> steroids, malignancy,
    and acute stress

## Presentation

- Episodic gnawing or burning epigastric pain, 2 - 5 hr after meals,
    nausea, vomiting, heartburn, bloating, postprandial belching, and
    loss of appetite
- Nocturnal pain: acid is secreted in absence of a food buffer
- Classic teaching for ulcers: Gastric (pain worse w/eating); Duodenal
    (pain better w/eating)
- May be asymptomatic until complications such as hemorrhage or
    perforation
- Alarm features: unintentional weight loss, persistent vomiting,
    melena, progressive dysphagia, early satiety, recurrent vomiting,
    palpable abdominal mass, lymphadenopathy, family history of upper
    gastrointestinal cancer, and iron deficiency anemia

## Evaluation

- CBC and H Pylori testing if no strong NSAID use history
- Urea breath or stool antigen (pt needs to stop PPI for 1-2 weeks, to
    avoid false - for both)
- EGD: if alarm features or patient is older than 55

## Management

- General: treat underlying cause (i.e. H. pylori, stop NSAIDs, etc),
    encourage smoking cessation, and limit alcohol intake to 1
    drink/day.
- If complicated peptic ulcer (i.e. bleeding, perforation, or gastric
    outlet obstruction):
    - EGD to determine etiology and for possible treatment
    - IV PPI (if bleeding IV PPI for 72 hrs after endoscopic treatment
    oral PPI)
- If uncomplicated peptic ulcer (not caused by H. pylori):
    - Antisecretory therapy with oral PPI (i.e. omeprazole 20 to 40 mg
    daily):
        - If caused by NSAIDs: Duration: \<1 cm ulcer 4-6 wks; ≥1 cm ulcer
        6-8 wks
    - If not caused by NSAIDs, Duration:
        - Duodenal ulcer: 4 weeks
        - Gastric ulcer: 8 weeks
- If ulcer caused by H. pylori:
    - Treat with PPI BID for 14 days with an appropriate combination
    antibiotic regimen.
    - Confirm H. pylori eradication (via stool antigen test, urease breath
    test, or EGD \>4 weeks after completion of therapy). If not
    eradicated, retreat

## Additional Information

- Continue maintenance PPI therapy (omeprazole 20 mg daily) for the
    following:
    - Peptic ulcer \>2 cm and age \>50 or multiple co-morbidities
    - Frequently recurrent peptic ulcers (\>2 in one year)
    - H. pylori-negative, NSAID-negative ulcer disease
    - Failure to eradicate H. pylori (including salvage therapy)
    - Condition requiring long term aspirin/NSAID use
    - Persistent ulcer on repeat EGD (if performed)
- Indications for repeat EGD (8-12 weeks):
    - Persistent/recurrent symptoms despite medical therapy
    - Complicated ulcer (bleeding), with evidence of ongoing bleeding
    - Giant gastric ulcer (\>2 cm) or features of malignancy at index
    endoscopy
    - Gastric ulcer that was not biopsied or inadequately sampled on
    initial EGD
    - Gastric ulcer in pt w/risk factors for gastric cancer (>50 yo, H.
    pylori, immigrant from high prevalence area [Japan, Korea, Taiwan,
    Costa Rica], FHx, presence of gastric atrophy, adenoma, dysplasia,
    intestinal metaplasia)
