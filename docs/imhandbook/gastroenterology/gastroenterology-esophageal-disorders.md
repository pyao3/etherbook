## Dysphagias

- Oropharyngeal dysphagia = difficulty initiating a swallow
- Associated with coughing, choking, nasopharyngeal regurgitation, and
    aspiration
- Causes: Structural (Zenker’s diverticula, malignancy, goiter,
    stricture, radiation injury, infection), Neuromuscular (stroke,
    Parkinson disease, dementia, ALS, MS)
- Esophageal dysphagia: Difficulty swallowing several seconds after
    initiation; associated w/sensation of food getting stuck in
    esophagus
- Dysphagia to solids = mechanical obstruction
    - Foreign body: Inability to swallow solids and/or liquids,
        including oral secretions
        - Most common foreign body = food in esophagus
    - Progressive: esophageal stricture, peptic stricture, esophageal,
        cancer
    - Intermittent: esophageal ring/web, eosinophilic esophagitis
        (particularly in young pts)
- Dysphagia to solids and liquids = motility disorder
    - Causes: achalasia, scleroderma, distal esophageal spasm (DES),
        hypercontractile (nutcracker) esophagus

## Evaluation

- If oropharyngeal dysphagia: videofluoroscopic modified barium
    swallow and fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES)
- When to order barium esophogram:
    - Pre-endoscopy if clinical history suspicious for proximal esophageal
        lesion (i.e. Zenker’s) or known complex stricture (post-caustic
        injury or radiation)
        - Don’t order if a food impaction is suspected or if imminent
            endoscopy
    - Post-endoscopy if mechanical obstruction is still suspected (EGD can
        miss lower esophageal rings or extrinsic esophageal compression)
- EGD if concerns for mechanical obstruction
- Manometry for motility disorders

## Management

- Food impaction: IV glucagon to relax lower esophageal sphincter to
    allow food passage
- Otherwise, requires urgent upper endoscopy for removal
- Additional management is specific to the final diagnosis

### Odynophagia

- Pain with swallowing
- Associated with esophagitis

PIECE mnemonic for esophagitis:

- Pill-induced: NSAIDs, ART, KCl, doxycycline, bisphosphonates
    - Discontinue culprit med or substitute with liquid formulation;
    prevent by taking culprit meds w/ 8oz water and sit upright for 30
    mins after
- Infectious: usually in immunosuppressed pts
- Candida Esophagitis: most common in HIV or heme malignancies, pts on
    antibiotics and steroid use
    - Can exist without OP thrush
    - Diagnosis: white mucosal plaque-like lesions on EGD biopsy and
        culture
- HSV Esophagitis. Occurs most commonly in solid organ, BMT transplant
    recipients, and immunosuppressed patients
    - Diagnosis: well-circumscribed ulcers on EGD, biopsy or brushings
        of ulcer edge
    - Rx: acyclovir 400mg PO five times daily for 14-21 days
        (immunocompromised) or acyclovir 5mg/kg IV q8h for 7-14 days if
        unable to tolerate PO; 200mg PO five times daily or 400mg PO
        three times daily for 7-10 days (immunocompetent)
- CMV Esophagitis: suspect in HIV pts w/ CD4\<50
    - Diagnosis: linear/longitudinal ulcers on EGD, biopsy
    - Rx: ganciclovir 5mg/kg IV q12h for 21-42 days; change to PO once
        pt able to tolerate; If contraindication to ganciclovir
        (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia) can use Foscarnet. PO
        valganciclovir can be used in patients who can tolerate and
        absorb oral medications. Treatment duration is 3-6 weeks based
        on expert opinion and response to disease
- Eosinophilic Esophagitis (see below)
- Caustic: alkali-induced injury, acid-induced injury, acute period
    (several days) following esophageal radiofrequency ablation for
    Barrett’s.
- GERD (see below)

### GERD

Background

- Condition that develops when reflux of stomach contents causes
    symptoms and/or complications
- Classified base on appearance of esophageal mucosa on EGD
- Erosive esophagitis: endoscopically visible breaks in distal
    esophageal mucosa + GERD
- Nonerosive reflux disease: presence of symptoms of GERD without
    esophageal mucosal injury

Presentation

- Esophageal symptoms: heartburn, regurgitation, chest pain,
    dysphagia, globus sensation, odynophagia
- Extra-esophageal symptoms: chronic cough, hoarseness
- Complications: Esophageal stricture, Barrett’s esophagus, esophageal
    adenocarcinoma

Evaluation

- Dx can often be made clinically in pts with classic heartburn and/or
    regurgitation
- If dx uncertain, can perform ambulatory pH monitoring + impedance
- EGD indicated for the following:
- Presence of alarm features (dysphagia, persistent vomiting, GI
    cancer in 1º relative, odynophagia, GI bleeding, weight loss, iron
    deficiency anemia, ≥age \> 60 y/o with new-onset GERD symptoms)
- Risk factors for Barrett’s esophagus (duration of GERD at least 5-10
    years \[must be present\], \>50 yo, male, white, hiatal hernia,
    obesity, nocturnal reflux, tobacco use, first-degree relative w/
    Barrett’s and/or adenocarcinoma)
- Abnormal UGI tract imaging (i.e. luminal abnormalities).
- Continued symptoms despite adequate PPI therapy

Management

- Lifestyle and dietary modifications in all pts (weight loss; elevate
    HOB; avoid precipitants such as fatty foods, caffeine, alcohol,
    spicy foods, large meals, late night meals)
- Mild/intermittent symptoms (\<2 episodes/wk) and no erosive
    esophagitis step-up therapy q4-8 wks until symptoms are controlled,
    then continue for at least 8 wks:
- Low-dose H2RA prn standard dose H2RA BID (min 2 wks) discontinue
    H2RA and start daily low dose PPI standard dose PPI
- Frequent symptoms (\>2 episodes/wk, and/or severe symptoms that
    impair QOL) step-down therapy in order to optimize symptom relief
- Standard-dose PPI daily (8 wks) low-dose PPI daily H2RA (if
    mild/intermittent symptoms) stop if asymptomatic
    - PPIs should be prescribed at lowest dose and for shortest
        duration appropriate
    - Instruct patients on optimal PPI use: most effective at gastric
        acid suppression when taken 30-60 minutes before a meal
    - Taper if taking for \>6 months and plan to discontinue
- Medications:
    - Low dose H2RA: famotidine 10mg BID
    - Standard dose H2RA: famotidine 20mg BID
    - Low dose PPI: omeprazole 10 mg daily
    - Standard dose PPI: omeprazole 20 mg daily

Additional Information

- Erosive esophagitis and Barrett’s esophagus:
    - Require maintenance acid suppression with a standard dose PPI daily
        given likelihood of recurrent symptoms and complications if stopped
- Recurrent Symptoms (2/3 of pts with nonerosive reflux disease
    relapse when acid suppression is discontinued):
    - If ≥3 months after discontinuing repeat 8-week course
    - If <3 months of discontinuing, EGD (if not already performed) to
        rule out other etiologies or complications

### Eosinophilic Esophagitis

Background

- Pt usually with a history of asthma/allergies/eczema
- Dysphagia (most commonly to solid foods), food impaction, central
    chest pain, GERD/refractory heartburn, upper abdominal pain

Evaluation

- Diagnostic criteria
- Symptoms related to esophageal dysfunction
- EGD with >15 eos/hpf on biopsy and exclusion of other causes
- 50-60% pts will have elevated serum IgE lvl; peripheral eosinophilia
    can be seen but is generally mild.

Management

- Standard dose PPI for 8 weeks +/- elimination diet if still
    symptomatic after 4 weeks, increase PPI to BID if responsive,
    continue PPI at lowest dose possible for symptom control
- Alternative treatment is swallowed budesonide or fluticasone
- Intermittent dilation of strictures to relieve dysphagia, but no
    effect on underlying inflammation
- Should undergo evaluation by allergist, given strong association
    with allergies
