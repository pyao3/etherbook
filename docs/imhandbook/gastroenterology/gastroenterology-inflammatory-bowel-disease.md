# Inflammatory Bowel Disease

## Background

- Ulcerative colitis (UC): colon only (can have backwash ileitis);
    contiguous lesions; mucosal inflammation
- Crohn’s disease (CD): any part of the GI tract; “skip lesions”;
    transmural inflammation
- Important historical considerations to include in your documentation
    and presentation:
    - Location of disease (CD: LB/SB, LB only, SB only; UC: proctitis,
    left-sided or pancolitis)
    - Complications: Fistulizing, strictures, perianal, prior surgeries,
    current IBD treatment
    - Include last endoscopies and imaging findings; current and prior IBD
    treatment and reason for transition (SEs, failure), primary IBD
    provider

## Presentation

- UC: frequent diarrhea (often bloody), tenesmus, urgency, abdominal
    pain; may have fever, malaise, and weight loss
    - Complications: severe bleeding/anemia, fulminant colitis, toxic
    megacolon
- CD: abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, fever, malaise, weight loss;
    May also have diarrhea (± bloody depending on CD location)
    - Complications: fistulas (entero-enteric, entero-vesicular,
    entero-cutaneous, rectovaginal, perianal, retroperitoneal),
    abscesses, strictures, obstruction
- Extra-intestinal (EI): arthritis, sacro-iliitis, uveitis,
    episcleritis, aphthous ulcers, erythema nodosum, pyoderma
    gangrenosum, PSC (esp. UC), nephrolithiasis, thromboembolism

## Evaluation

- CBC w/diff, CMP, CRP, ESR, ± blood cultures
- If diarrhea: GI Pathogen panel and C. diff
- If anemic: obtain iron studies and type & screen
- If weight loss or concern for malnutrition: albumin, pre-albumin,
    Vitamin D, B12, folate
- Imaging:
    - CT Enterography (oral contrast) preferred in CD, for
    luminal/extra-luminal complications
    - How to order CTE: “CT abdomen pelvis enterography”, order barium
    (Volumen) 0.1% oral suspension x2, 1st dose to be given by nurse 60
    min before study, 2nd study to be given 30 min before (nurse should
    be in contact with CT tech)

## Management

- Acute Flare
- Pain control: usually a major component of hospital course
    - Avoid NSAIDs, oral pain medications are preferred
    - If pain is difficult to control, consider Acute Pain Service
        consult
    - Narcotics and Imodium are contraindicated in toxic megacolon
- Antibiotics: appropriately treat infections (intra-abdominal or
    perianal abscess) with antibiotics (consider prior culture data,
    often use cipro/flagyl)
- VTE Prophylaxis: All IBD patients, even if having blood in stool
    (unless requiring transfusion) as they are at much higher risk of
    VTE
- Nutrition: Nutrition consult for all IBD patients; For severe
    malnutrition or if prolonged bowel rest is needed, TPN is sometimes
    initiated
- Anemia: Ferritin \<100 or iron sat \<20 with ferritin \<300,
    consider iron infusions (if no bacteremia) or transfuse for severe
    anemia
- Smoking Cessation (esp. with CD): discuss smoking cessation &
    consult tobacco cessation
- Consult Colorectal Surgery (not EGS): SBO, toxic megacolon, bowel
    perforation, peritonitis
- Immunosuppression: (Infections must be ruled out and/or treated
    before starting)
- Steroids:
    - Methylprednisolone (Solumedrol); often 20 mg BID for three days
    - Transition to oral (40 mg prednisone daily) once clinically
        improved/tolerating PO; typically prescribe a prolonged taper on
        discharge (often down by 5 mg every week)
    - If severe proctitis: consider rectal steroids (hydrocortisone
        enema/foam)
- If lack of response to steroids: additional medical therapy
    (biologics), bowel rest with TPN, or surgical intervention
    - Infliximab (Inflectra) is available at VUMC
    - If patient fails to respond to steroids, should consider
        possibility of CMV colitis (usually evaluated by biopsy on flex
        sig or colonoscopy)
    - Prior to initiating a biologic, all patients must have the
        following negative studies within the last year: Quantiferon
        Gold and CXR, Hepatitis B serologies, HIV, urine histoplasma Ag
        (some providers)
