# Acute Pancreatitis

---

## Background

- Common causes: Gallstones (40%), EtOH (30%)
- Other causes: post-ERCP, pancreatic cancer/obstruction, blunt
    abdominal trauma, hypertriglyceridemia (TG >1000), hypercalcemia,
    drugs (thiazides, protease inhibitors, azathioprine, 6MP), mumps,
    Coxsackie, vasculitis, pregnancy, genetic (PRSS1, SPINK1, CFTR),
    autoimmune (IgG4), scorpion venom
- Several scoring systems:
    - BISAP (BUN >25, Impaired mental status, SIRS, Age >60, Pleural
    effusion)
        - 0–2 Mortality <2%; 3-5 Mortality >15%
    - APACHE II (MD Calc, several factors)
        - 0–8 Mortality <4%; > 8 Mortality 11–18%

## Presentation

- Must have 2 out of the three:
    - Pain characteristic of pancreatitis (sharp, epigastric, radiating to
    back)
    - Imaging characteristic of pancreatitis (US, CT, MRI)
    - Enzymes (lipase or amylase) \>3x ULN (use lipase, much more
    specific)
    - \*If pain is characteristic and lipase > 3x ULN, no need for CT A/P
- Grading Severity:
    - Mild: no organ failure or systemic complications
    - Moderate: transient organ failure (<48 hours)
    - Severe: persistent organ failure (>48 hours)

## Evaluation

- Lipase, CBC, CMP, lipid panel, lactate, direct bilirubin
- Obtain RUQ U/S for all pts, evaluates for gallstones
- CT A/P w/ IV contrast if indicated
    - Reserved for patients not improving at 48-72 hour to assess for
    complications
    - If performed at onset, underestimates severity (necrosis takes 72
    hours from onset)

## Management

- Fluids, Fluids, Fluids:
    - First 12-24 hrs: IVF at 200 to 500 cc/hr, or 5-10 cc/kg / hr (2.5 –
    > 4 L within first 24 hrs)
    - Follow HCT and BUN as markers for successful fluid resuscitation
    - Aggressive IVF in first 24 hours reduces both morbidity and
    mortality
    - Persistent hemoconcentration at 24 hr is associated with necrotizing
    pancreatitis
- Pain Control:
    - Common starting narcotic regimen is oxycodone 10 mg q6h PRN and
    hydromorphone 0.5 mg q4h for breakthrough
- Nutrition:
    - NPO but start PO diet as soon as patient can tolerate (even within
    24 hours)
    - Clear liquid diet or mechanical soft and advance as tolerated
    - Low fat diet (Fatty acids → CCK → trypsinogen to trypsin)
    - If NPO > 72 hours, attempt PO and if fail, place Dobhoff for
    enteral nutrition at latest by day five… outcomes with NG/NJ >>>
    TPN
- Antibiotics:
    - Fever, leukocytosis common, not an indication for ABX as the
    necrosis is sterile
    - Infection of the necrosis should be suspected with failure to
    improve 7 days after onset
    - Cefepime + Flagyl or carbapenem
- EUS or IR guided drain for aspirate: can be done on immature
    collections for diagnostic purposes but typically only done if
    collection is walled-off—at least 4 weeks
- Endoscopic Intervention (cystogastrostomy) has emerged as first-line
    therapy for symptomatic pseudocysts or walled-off pancreatic
    necrosis , with step-up therapy to video assisted retroperitoneal
    debridement (VARD) or surgery when needed

## Additional Information

- If choledocholithiasis on Imaging urgent ERCP for patients with
    cholangitis or obstructive jaundice, otherwise elective ERCP
- If Intermediate probability for choledocholithiasis MRCP or EUS or
    (for patients requiring cholecystectomy Intraoperative cholangiogram
- If biliary sludge but no stones on U/S, still consider
    cholecystectomy (likely microlithiasis)
- Complications:
    - ARDS, abdominal compartment syndrome, AKI, DIC
    - < 4 weeks after pancreatitis: Peripancreatic fluid collection,
    acute necrotic collection
    - > 6 weeks after pancreatitis: Pancreatic pseudocyst, walled-off
    necrosis (WON)
- Most fluid collections should be followed over time as acute
    collections can resolve and are unable to be sampled safely with EUS
- Gallstone pancreatitis:
    - All pts should have cholecystectomy once recovered (recurrence is
    25-30%) with EGS
    - Performed during initial admission in cases of mild acute
    pancreatitis
