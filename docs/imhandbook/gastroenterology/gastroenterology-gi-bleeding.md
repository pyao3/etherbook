# GI Bleeding 

Matthew Meyers

---

## Background

- Intraluminal blood loss anywhere from the nasopharynx/oral cavity to
    the anus
- Don’t forget epistaxis or oropharyngeal bleeding as possible source
    of melena
- IV PPI prior to endoscopy may ↓ need for endoscopic therapy but does
    not impact transfusion requirement, rebleeding risk, need for
    surgical intervention, or mortality
- Classification: relative location to the Ligament of Treitz (LoT)
- Upper = proximal to LoT
    - PUD, gastritis (alcohol, stress, NSAIDs, ASA), esophagitis,
        variceal bleed, Mallory-Weiss tear, AVM, Dieulafoy’s lesion,
        aorto-enteric fistula, gastric antral vascular ectasias,
        malignancy
- Lower = distal to LoT
    - Diverticular bleed, ischemic/infectious/IBD/radiation colitis,
        malignancy, angiodysplasia, anorectal (hemorrhoids, anal
        fissure), Meckel’s diverticulum, post-polypectomy bleed

## Presentation

- Hematemesis (very specific for upper GI bleed), hematochezia
    (usually lower although brisk upper possible), melena (usually
    upper), coffee-ground emesis, epigastric/abdominal pain, acute or
    chronic, hx of GI bleed and prior endoscopies, NSAID use, alcohol
    use, anticoagulant use, hx of cirrhosis
- Exam: VITALS – assess stability to determine resuscitation needs,
    MICU vs. floor; orthostatic vs, rectal exam every time (smear stool
    on white tissue paper to look for melena), look for signs of
    cirrhosis (jaundice, palmar erythema, ascites, spider angiomata)

## Evaluation

- CBC, PT/INR, CMP, Lactic Acid, Blood Gas
- EGD: usually best
- Difficulty localizing GIB: pill-capsule, balloon enteroscopy
    Meckel’s scan, tagged RBC scan
- Massive lower GI bleeds will require arteriography

## Management

- Secure airway (intubation) if comatose, extremely combative, or
    massive hematemesis
- At least 2 large bore IV’s (> 18 gauge) – ask nurses directly to
    ensure these are placed
- Maintain active type and screen
- Bolus IVF to maintain MAP >65H/H monitoring q6-q12 hours;
    transfusions as indicated
- IV PPI (pantoprazole) 40 mg BID if thought to be upper/possible
    ulcer
- If cirrhotic, Ceftriaxone 1g daily for empiric SBP prophylaxis
- If possibility of variceal bleed: Octreotide IV 50 mcg x1 then 50
    mcg/hr drip x 3-5 days
- NPO if unstable vs. clear liquids (no reds or purples) until morning
    for EGD
- Never give prep to a patient for colonoscopy (GoLytely) without
    discussing with GI fellow
- Consult gastroenterology to facilitate endoscopy
- If endoscopy is unable to stop bleeding IR is next who can embolize
- If embolization fails EGS for source removal
