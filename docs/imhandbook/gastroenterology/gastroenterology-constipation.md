# Constipation

Chelsie Sievers

## Background

- Definition: presence of lumpy/hard stools, straining, use of digital
    maneuvers, sensation of incomplete evacuation, frequency \<3 BM per
    week.
- Common etiologies: opioid-induced, medications (anti-depressants,
    iron, anticholinergics) hypothyroidism, hypokalemia, pregnancy, IBS,
    neurogenic (trauma, MS, Parkinson disease, diabetes, autonomic
    dysregulation).
- Always think about risk of obstruction (prior abdominal surgeries,
    oncology history or risk for GI/GU malignancies, history of
    IBD/Crohn’s).

## Evaluation

- Evaluate etiologies plus lifestyle factors (low fiber intake, low
    fluid intake, reduced mobility, acute illness)
- Clinical diagnosis, no need for imaging unless concerned for
    obstruction → KUB/ CT
- BMP + Mg to evaluate electrolytes, consider TSH if chronic
- Rectal exam to exclude rectal mass or fecal impaction
    (constipation + diarrhea doesn’t exclude impaction/obstruction.
    Overflow around mass = encoparesis)

## Management

- Stop or minimize offending medications if possible
- Optimize lifestyle factors: out of bed, walking hallways, increase
    fluid intake, + cup of coffee if appropriate.
- Escalating pathway: ensure meds are scheduled not PRN
    - MiraLAX (PEG) 17g BID (can give TID) + Senna nightly (can
        > increase to BID and/or 2 tabs) → Bisacodyl suppository → enema
        > (tap water or SMOG) → stronger osmotic laxative (lactulose
        > 20mg once, Mag-citrate, Golytely) → escalate lactulose dosing
        > 20 – 30 mg q2hrs
- Other considerations:
    - Avoid Fleet enemas (sodium-phosphate) in CKD and geriatric
        > populations
    - “The hand that writes for opioids also writes a bowel regimen”
        - Generally, start with scheduled MiraLAX (PEG) 17g daily +
          senna nightly
        - If severe and unrelieved by escalating therapies, can try
          methylnaltrexone
    - Lactulose can cause severe bloating and cramping
    - In patients unable to take PO: place DHT to deliver meds or
        rectal lactulose (important for patients with cirrhosis with
        AMS/HE).
    - In patients with CF (at risk for distal intestinal obstruction
        syndrome): ensure have pancreatic enzymes ordered, managed
        more like constipation than true obstruction: PO/ NGT MiraLAX
        QID or Golytely.
    - Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome): \>12cm
        cecal diameter = severe dilation, risk of perforation. Treated
        with neostigmine, 2mg IV over 3 to 5 minutes. Monitor for
        bradycardia, hypotension, and dysrhythmias (relative
        contraindications: recent MI, asthma, PUD, epilepsy).
        Decompression with colonoscopy used in some cases.
    - Consider pelvic floor dysfunction, pelvic floor PT may be
        helpful
