## Background

- Diagnose by the Rome IV criteria, no longer a diagnosis of exclusion
- Recurrent abdominal pain on average at least 1 day/week in the last
    3 months with an onset at least 6 months prior, associated
    with **two or more** of the following criteria
    - Pain related to defecation
    - Change in frequency of stool
    - Change in form (appearance) of stool
- Patient has none of the following warning signs: \>50yrs, evidence
    of GIB, nocturnal pain or BMs, unintentional weight loss, family hx
    of colorectal cancer or IBD, palpable abdominal mass or LAD, IDA,
    +FOBT
- Classified based on predominant bowel habits
    - Diarrhea: >25% BMs with Bristol stool types 6 or 7
    - Constipation: >25% BMs with Bristol stool types 1 or 2
    - Mixed: both of above

## Evaluation

- Thorough H&P for alarm symptoms as above
- Consider limited testing with CBC, CMP, CRP, celiac serology, fecal
    calprotectin

## Management

- Treatment involves lifestyle and dietary modifications, psychosocial
    treatment, and pharmacologic treatment
- Pain:
    - Peppermint oil (smooth muscle relaxant) – IBGuard, Iberogast
    - Antispasmodics: Hyosciamine acts faster than Dicyclomine
    - TCAs: Amitriptyline or nortriptyline (causes less constipation so
    better in IBS-C)
- Bloating:
    - Low FODMAP diet
    - Rifaximin as empiric treatment for SIBO
    - No evidence for probiotics (can potentially worsen bloating 2/2
    SIBO)
- Bowel regulation:
    - IBS-D: Start with Loperamide (up to 16g daily), consider Lomotil if
    refractory
    - IBS-C: Miralax, fiber supplement (Ispaghula husk orange), Linzess
    (first line but can be expensive), Trulance, or Amitiza
- Other
    - Psychotherapy, CBT
    - SSRIs, SNRIs for concomitant mood disorders
    - Gabapentin, lyrica
