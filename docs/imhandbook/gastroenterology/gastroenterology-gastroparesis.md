# Gastroparesis

## Background

- Syndrome of objectively delayed gastric emptying in absence of
    mechanical obstruction
- Etiology: Diabetes (most common), post-surgical (gastric or
    bariatric surgery), thyroid dysfunction, autoimmune or neurologic
    disorders, medication-induced (GLP-1 agonists, narcotics,
    anticholinergic agents

## Presentation

- Nausea, vomiting (may contain food eaten several hours prior),
    abdominal pain (dull, crampy; rarely a predominant symptom), early
    satiety, postprandial fullness, bloating, weight loss in severe
    cases

## Evaluation

- Exclude mechanical obstruction and mucosal disease with CTE and EGD
- Scintigraphic gastric emptying study = gold standard for diagnosis
    (measures gastric retention of solids at 4h)
- Stop medications that may affect gastric emptying 48 hrs prior to
    testing
- Must have blood sugar \< 275 (Hyperglycemia delays gastric emptying)

## Management

- Support with IVF and electrolytes â€“ PO intake preferred
- Glycemic control in diabetics
- Stop offending medications
- Nutrition consult for teaching on frequent small volume meals that
    are low in fat and soluble fiber
- If continued symptoms after above, try prokinetics and antiemetics
- Prokinetics
    - Liquid formulations preferred for better absorption
    - Give 15min before meals and at bedtime.
    - First line is Reglan. If no response, try Domperidone and
        subsequently erythromycin (not good for long term, pts develop
        tachyphylaxis)
- Antiemetics: helps symptoms but do not improve gastric emptying
- In severe cases patients may require enteral feeding (post pyloric
    preferred) or venting g-tube
- Emerging endoscopic treatment options: G-POEM (gastric peroral
    endoscopic myotomy)
