# Acute Diverticulitis

Michael Koenig

---

## Background

- Inflammation and/or infection of a diverticulum, a small
    out-pouching along wall of colon
- Presence of colonic flora on urine culture or pneumaturia suggests
    colovesical fistula
- Most pts with uncomplicated diverticulitis have significant
    improvement 2-3 days after antibiotics

## Presentation

- Lower abdominal pain (85% LLQ), tenderness to palpation on exam,
    N/V, low-grade fever, change in bowel habits (constipation or
    diarrhea)

## Evaluation

- CBC w/diff, CMP, Lipase, U/A, β - hCG
- Imaging: CT abdomen/pelvis with oral and IV contrast
- CT findings: localized bowel wall thickening (\>4mm), paracolic fat
    stranding, presence of colonic diverticula

## Management

- Bowel rest vs. clear liquids (advance diet as tolerated)
- PO or IV antibiotics: should cover GNRs and anaerobic organisms
- Zosyn, cefepime + metronidazole, or meropenem (if high risk for
    organisms w/ESBL)
- Cipro/flagyl if PO
- If low risk and mild disease, may not need antibiotics
- Continue IV abx until abdominal pain/tenderness is resolved (usually
    3-5 days), then transition to oral: cipro + metronidazole or
    Augmentin to complete 10-14 d course
- Colonoscopy after complete resolution of symptoms (6 – 8 weeks) to
    definitively rule out presence of underlying colorectal cancer
    (unless performed in last year)

## Complications

- Pts who fail to improve or deteriorate require repeat imaging
- Abscess continue antibiotics & percutaneous drainage (if possible)
    for abscesses > 4 cm
- Surgery if no improvement 2-3 days after drainage
- Obstruction: radiographic differentiation between acute
    diverticulitis and colon cancer is difficult; thus surgical
    resection of bowel is needed to relieve obstruction and rule out
    cancer
- Fistula: Rarely heal spontaneously, require surgical correction
- Perforation:
    - Microperforation (contained perforation):
    - Presence of small amount of air bubbles, but no oral contrast
        outside of colon on CT
    - Most treated with IV abx and bowel rest like uncomplicated
        diverticulitis
    - Frank perforation:
        - Intraabdominal free air, diffuse peritonitis requires emergency
            surgery
