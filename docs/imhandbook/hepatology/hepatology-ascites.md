# Ascites 

## Background

- Associated with a reduction in 5 year survival from 80% to 30%.

- Most often due to portal hypertension. Less common causes include peritoneal or metastatic cancer, heart failure, tuberculosis, nephrotic syndrome, Budd-Chiari, sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (S.O.S), or complications from procedures and pancreatitis

| Grade 3 Ascites | Marked, tense abdominal distension       | LVP + Na restriction, diuretics (unless refractory) |

## Evaluation

- Bedside ultrasound on admission to confirm presence of ascites

- Diagnostic paracentesis in all pts with ascites on admission mainly to rule out occult SBP
    - Initial paracentesis or when cause of ascites is uncertain: Total Protein, serum and BF Albumin, cell count w/diff, culture
    - Subsequent/Serial paracenteses: cell count w/diff, culture, protein
    - Always inoculate culture bottles at bedside (VA does not allow bedside innoculation)

- See Procedure section for guidance on paracentesis. 

- Serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) = serum albumin - ascites albumin.

-   Calculate PMNs from fluid (see SBP below)

-   Other tests:
    -   Triglycerides: if fluid is milky
    -   Cytology: if very concerned for peritoneal carcinomatosis. May need up to 3 separate samples (50ml or more) to be able to detect malignant cells
    -   ADA: if concern for peritoneal TB
    -   Hematocrit: For bloody appearing fluid (not just serosanguinous) to rule out hemoperitoneum. There needs to be a recent serum HCT for comparison.
    -   Amylase: If concerned for pancreatic ascites
    -   Glucose, LDH if concern about secondary peritonitis (see below)

## Management

- 2000mg sodium restriction per day for all ascites (Grade 1-3)

- Diuretics (spironolactone and typically furosemide)
    - Start at 100mg of spironolactone with up titration to 400mg
    - Furosemide is added if insufficient diuresis or if limited by hyperkalemia. Use more loop diuretics in patients with CKD
    - If Urine Na:K ratio <1, indicates insufficient natriuresis. Can ↑ doses to a max of 400:160
    - If poor response can change to torsemide 10mg and ↑ to 40mg max (per single dose)
    - Fluid restriction usually not necessary unless serum sodium <125 mmol/L

- Large volume paracentesis should be performed for tense ascites or refractory ascites (grade 3), regardless of serum Cr. Pts should be tapped dry with each paracentesis

- Give 6-8g of albumin per liter of ascites removed, even if < 5L

- Target weight loss of 0.5 kg/day when diuresing to avoid renal injury

- Discontinue NSAIDs and ACEI/ARB

## Refractory Ascites:

- Two distinctions:
    - Diuretic-resistant: lack of response to diuretics (max spironolactone 400mg/lasix 160mg), Na restriction and rapid recurrence following paracentesis
    - Diuretic-intractable: unable to tolerate diuretic therapy 2/2 adverse drug effects (unexplained HE, AKI, K abnormalities, hypoNa, intractable muscle cramps)

- Management aside from liver transplant:
    - Discontinue diuretics once refractory ascites has been established
    - Consider oral midodrine; can be especially helpful if pt is also hypotensive
    - Serial paracenteses, generally arranged OP with IR
    - Consider TIPS (trans jugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt; has survival benefit). Following TIPS, cessation or decrease in ascites should occur in 4-6 weeks
    - Consider discontinuing beta blockers in patients with refractory ascites if sBP <90, SCr >1.5, or Na <130

# Hepatic Hydrothorax

## Background

- Transudative effusion, typically unilateral (75% right sided); reflects ascitic fluid that passes through defects in the diaphragm. 10% can develop without clinical ascites.

- Present in 4-12% of cirrhotics and portends a poor prognosis (75% mortality within 90 days)

## Evaluation

- Often suspected clinically, though must exclude pleural/cardiopulmonary process

- Thoracentesis will demonstrate a transudative effusion and should be evaluated with standard pleural fluid lab tests: cell count, protein, albumin, LDH, culture
    - Other considerations: triglycerides, amylase, hematocrit, cytology

- Rule out SBE which is diagnosed the same as SBP (PMN>250)

## Management

- Similar management of ascites as noted above

- AVOID chest-tube placement. associated with increased morbidity and mortality due to extensive loss of fluid, electrolytes and protein as well as increased infection risk
    - PleurX catheters can be considered for palliation (e.g., hospice patients)
    
- Refractory Hydrothorax is defined similarly and managed similarly with serial thoracentesis or TIPS. 

- Management of spontaneous bacterial empyema is the same as in SBP (see below)
