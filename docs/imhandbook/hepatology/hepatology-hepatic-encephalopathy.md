# Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE) 

## Evaluation
- Asterixis: inability to maintain stable posture; many ways to assess
    - Check for clonus
    - Have pt “hold out hands like you are stopping traffic” (if following commands)
    - Shine light in pupil (look up video of hippus)

-   Identify precipitants
    -   Infection (rule out SBP in addition to CXR, BCx, UA/Cx
        regardless of sxs),
    -   Medication non-adherence (lactulose)
    -   GI bleed (perform rectal exam and observe hgb trend)
    -   Over-diuresis resulting in dehydration, lyte abnormalities
        (especially hypoK)
    -   Sedatives/benzo/opiate administration (UDS)
    -   Post-TIPS, other large but spontaneous shunt (imaging can be
        useful to determine if there is a shunt, and if an intervention
        is feasible on such a shunt).
-   Ammonia (NH <sub>3</sub> ) levels do not play a role in the acute
    management of hepatic encephalopathy; if pt has AMS or HE, you will
    treat the HE regardless
-   Arterial NH <sub>3</sub> is used in acute liver failure for
    **prognostication** (not for management)

## Management

-   Always determine precipitant and treat underlying condition

-   Lactulose 30mL TID initially
    -   Titrate dose to at least 4 BMs daily, avoid excessive stool
        output which may exacerbate HE due to dehydration and
        electrolyte abnormalities
    -   Consider lactulose enemas vs DHT placement if pt unable to
        tolerate PO
        -   DHT are **not** contraindicated in patients with esophageal
            varices, but should be avoided in patients with recent
            hemorrhage or banding
    -   Add Rifaximin after the second episode of HE, or if failure to
        respond to lactulose
        -   Frequently requires prior auth for OP approval and is
            expensive
-   Lactulose is generally continued indefinitely after first episode of
    HE, though discontinuation can be considered if predisposing factors
    (recurrent infection, EVH, EtOH use) have resolved
