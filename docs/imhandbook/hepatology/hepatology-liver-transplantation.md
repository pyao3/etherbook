# Liver Transplant (LT) Workup

Lauren Evers Carlini

## Background

- Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD-Na) score: initially developed to predict survival following TIPS placement, though is now used to objectively rank patients in terms of priority for liver transplant (LT)
    - Factors in total bilirubin, creatinine, and INR. An updated version,
    the MELD-Na score, factors in the serum Na as well.
    -   Exception points given for complications like HCC and
        hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS), leading to score in mid to high
        20’s even if biologic MELD is low
-   Listing a patient for LT is determined by a multidisciplinary transplant
    committee
    -   Acute liver failure pts take precedence over decompensated
        cirrhosis pts for LT

## Evaluation 

-   Abdominal CT (triple phase) or MRI (multiphase with contrast) to
    evaluate for hepatic malignancy and vascular anatomy

-   Infectious workup: TB testing, HIV, RPR, VZV, CMV, EBV, and
    Hepatitis A, B, and C.

-   Cardiac evaluation: EKG and TTE with bubble are required. Functional testing: CT coronaries with fractional flow, invasive angiography and intervention may be necessary depending on pre-test probability. 

-   PFT’s, carotid ultrasound, panorex, etc. 

-   Appropriate cancer screenings (colonoscopy, pap smear, mammogram, and PSA
    if applicable)

-   DEXA scan

-   Certification of completion of intensive outpatient program (IOP)
    for substance abuse

-   Evaluation by hepatobiliary surgical team after obtaining cross
    sectional imaging

-   Psychosocial evaluation (consult Psychiatry, social work)

-   Current VUMC policy: pts should be abstinent from alcohol no less than 3-6 months, although exceptions may be m ade for early liver transplant based on a very strict protocol. Discuss exception criteria iwth attending if suspect patient unlikely to survive hospitalization without transplant 

-   Both living and deceased donor transplant are offered at VUMC. Donor
    evaluation, however, cannot be started before the potential
    recipient is deemed a candidate
