# Coagulopathy in Cirrhosis 

Garren Montgomery, John Laurenzano

--- 

## Background

- The liver is responsible for production of both pro- (factor II, V, VII, IV, X, and XI) and anti-coagulants (protein C, S) in hemostasis. Factor VIII is the only one not made by the liver.
- Thrombocytopenia is caused by splenic sequestration from portal HTN, failure to produce thrombopoietin (TPO), and bone marrow failure

## Evaluation

- INR/PT, and PTT are poorly reflective of bleeding risk

- TEG screens and other measures of comprehensive coagulation in cirrhotics

## Management

- Even in bleeding, there is no need to intervene on an INR or platelet value

- Pre-procedural FFP is not recommended, even in the presence of bleeding, but is frequently requested by different proceduralists

- Low risk procedures (i.e., paracentesis) do not require pre-procedural blood products

- In bleeding pts, the following are recommended per AASLD and AGA guidelines
    - IV Vitamin K 10mg x 3 days
    - FFP: Not recommended, unless as part of a balanced transfusion effort to avoid transfusion related coagulopathy, or if a TEG screen suggests potential benefit
    - Cryoprecipitate: if fibrinogen < 120
    - Platelets: No specific targets regardless of bleeding. Pre-procedurally, recommend >50

- Appropriate DVT ppx should be given with few exceptions (plts <50k, active hemorrhage)

- For TEG transfusion recommendations are as follows:
    - 10 mg/kg FFP if R-time >10 minutes
    - 1u Plts if maximum amplitude <55 mm
    - 5u cryo if alpha angle <45
