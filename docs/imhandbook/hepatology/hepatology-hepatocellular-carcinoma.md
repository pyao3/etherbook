# Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)

## Background

- Pts with HCV cirrhosis are at greatest risk (incidence 2-4% per year)

- In chronic HBV and NASH, pts can develop HCC without having cirrhosis

## Evaluation

- Regular screening in pts with cirrhosis (or chronic HBV without cirrhosis) for HCC
    - RUQ U/S q6mo (with or without AFP)
    - Routine screening with CT or MRI is not recommended

- Options If U/S not satisfactory:
    - CT A/P w/contrast, in comments specify triple phase for HCC screening
    - MRI, specify Gadovist (preferred contrast agent)
    - Contrast-enhanced ultrasound

- AFP trend is more useful than one value in time, though AFP >20 should prompt multiphase CT or MRI for further evaluation

- Diagnosis can be made either by imaging (most common) or biopsy (rare)
   - Triple phase CT demonstrates strong early uptake in arterial phase, with subsequent wash-out in portal-venous phase
   - If diagnosis remains unclear: can surveillance imaging or biopsy
   - LI-RADS system notes risk of malignancy based on imaging characteristics

| LR-1 to LR-2 | Definitely/Probably benign | Routine surveillance, consider diagnostic imaging within 6 mos                 |
| LR-3 to LR-4 | Indeterminate/Probably HCC | Repeat or alternative diagnostic imaging in 3-6 mos. Consider Bx for LI-RADS 4 |
| LR-5         | Definitely HCC             | Plan treatment as noted below                                                  |

## Management

- Lesions that meet Milan criteria can qualify for MELD exception points and are considered transplant candidates
    - This accounts for pts with minimal synthetic dysfunction (and therefore low MELD)

- Milan criteria:
    - Single tumor with diameter >2cm but <5 cm, no more than 3 tumors, each <3 cm
    - No signs of extra-hepatic involvement or vascular invasion

- Liver transplant is definitive treatment, although resection can also be curative (favored in pts with early cirrhosis i.e. Child Pugh A)
- Locoregional therapies: Pts with unresectable disease, or who are not surgical candidates

| Radiofrequency ablation                    | If in a favorable location and size, IR can percutaneously ablate with a large needle that emits microwave frequencies  |
| Trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE)    | Chemotherapeutic agents injected into the tumor to occlude the feeding blood supply to the area.                        |
| Trans-arterial radioembolization (TARE)    | Like TACE, though radioactive compound (i.e. Y-90) used to occlude the feeding blood supply.                            |
| Stereotactic body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) | Radiation therapy: can be used as an alternative to ablation and is generally performed in those meeting Milan criteria |
| Systemic Chemotherapy                      | For metastatic disease                                                                                                  |
