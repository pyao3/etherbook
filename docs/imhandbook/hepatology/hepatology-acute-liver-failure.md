# Acute Liver Injury and Failure 

Hannah Lomzenski, and Lauren Chan

---

## Background

- Acute liver injury (ALI): elevated liver enzymes + INR ≥1.5 but NO encephalopathy

- Acute liver failure (ALF): elevated liver enzymes + encephalopathy/AMS in the absence of pre-existing liver disease*
    - \*Chronic autoimmune hepatitis, HBV, Wilson disease, and Budd-Chiari syndrome can have ALF if they develop new AMS, despite the presence of a pre-existing liver disease

- Alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) is not ALF (see above)

## Etiology

- R-factor (if history, exam, and diagnostic data are inconclusive i.e. R-factor is not a replacement to clinical judgement) = (ALT/uln ALT) / (ALP/uln ALP); See chart below
    - R > 5 = hepatocellular injury; R<2 = cholestatic injury; R 2-5 = mixed injury

- Isolated hyperbilirubinemia: Differentiate direct versus indirect
    - Direct: Refer to cholestatic pattern
    - Indirect: Gilbert vs hemolysis

- Drugs Associated with liver injury
    - Hepatocellular pattern: acarbose, Acetaminophen, Allopurinol, Amiodarone, Baclofen, Bupropion, Fluoxetine, HAART (Nevirapine), Kava kava, Isoniazid, Ketoconazole, Lisinopril, Losartan, Methotrexate, NSAIDs, Omeprazole, Oxacillin/Nafcillin, Paroxetine, Pyrazinamide, Propylthiouracil, Rifampin, Risperidone, Sertraline, Statins, Tetracycline, Trazodone, Valproic Acid

    - Mixed pattern: Amitriptyline, Azathioprine, Captopril, Carbamazepine, Clindamycin, Cyproheptadine, Enalapril, Flutemide, Nitrofurantoin, Phenobarbital, Phenytoin, Sulfonamides, Trazodone, Verapamil

    - Cholestatic pattern: Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, Anabolic steroids, Chlorpromazine, Clopidogrel, Oral contraceptives, Erythromycins, Estrogens, Irbesartan, Mirtazapine, Phenothiazines, Terbinafine, Tricyclics

## Evaluation

-   Consult hepatology early! (to assist with workup AND for transplant
    evaluation)
-   Labs:
    -   CBC w/diff, CMP, Dbili, Mg, Phos, T&S, BCx, UCx, PT/INR, aPTT, fibrinogen
    -   Amylase, lipase 
    -   Beta-hCG for females of reproductive age
    -   ABG with arterial lactate, ammonia (arterial >124 predicts mortality and CNS complications e.g. need for intubation, seizures, cerebral edema, <75 very unlikely to develop ICH) 
    -   Viral etiologies: Virtal hepatitis serologies (HAV panel, HBV panel, HCV IgG +/- PCR quant, HDV if known HBV (with low or undetectable HBV load as Misc Reference Test, Hepatitis E PCR ent as miscellaneous if pregnant or travel to southeast Asia), HIV p24 Ag and HIV Ab, EBV Qt, CMV Qt, HSV 1/2 Qt, VZV IgM/IgG
    -   Toxins: UDS, ethanol level +/- Peth, acetaminophen level (drawn > 4 hours after last known ingestion), Salicylate level
    -   Autoimmune / genetic: ANA, ASMA, IgG, AMA (if predominantly elevated ALP), ceruloplasmin

-   Imaging:
    -   RUQ abdominal ultrasound **with doppler** (important to assess
        vasculature!)
    -   Consider CT with contrast in patients with normal renal function
        and high suspicion of Budd-Chiari syndrome or malignancy with
        negative ultrasound  (better for assessing the hepatic veins)
        and helps with transplant evaluation
    -   Consider TTE to rule out cardiac dysfunction; helpful for
        transplant consideration

## Criteria for Transplantation:

-   King’s College criteria:
    helps identify patients needing transplant referral/consideration
    -   ALF due to acetaminophen:
        -   Arterial pH \<7.3 after resuscitation and >24 hr since
            ingestion, OR
        -   Arterial Lactate >3 after adequate fluid resuscitation, OR
        -   Grade III-IV HE, SCr >3.4, **and** INR >6.5 all within 24h period
-   ALF not due to acetaminophen: INR > 6.5 OR 3 of the 5 following
    criteria:
    -   Indeterminate etiology, drug-induced hepatitis
    -   Age \<10 or >40
    -   Interval of jaundice to encephalopathy >7 days
    -   Bilirubin > 17.5 mg/dl (300 micromol/L) 
    -   INR >3.5

## Management

-   Any pt with concern for ALF should be cared for in MICU (even if mild change in mental status)
-   Pts with ALF die acutely from hypoglycemia, cerebral edema, and
    infection
-   ABC’s:
    -   Intubate for GCS \<8, Grade 3 or 4 HE
    -   IVF resuscitation with isotonic crystalloid (most pts are volume
        deplete; avoid hypotonic fluids due to risk of cerebral edema)
    -   Vasopressive agents for persistent hypotension (norepinephrine
        preferred)
-   Monitoring:
    -   Q1-2h neuro checks, Q1-2h glucose checks
    -   Closely monitor CMP, INR q6-8 hrs
-   Treatment of Primary Injury
    -   IV N-acetylcysteine - improves transplant-free survival even in
        patients WITHOUT acetaminophen induced acute liver failure
        -   Initial loading dose = 150mg/kg over 1 hour, then 50mg/kg/hr
            for 4 hours, then 100mg/kg/hr for 16 hours ​​​​​​​
        -   Patients with early stage hepatic encephalopathy (grade
            I/II) have increased transplant free survival, while those
            with grade III/IV do not
    -   See below for etiology-specific treatment; hepatology consult
        for LT eval
    -   Early toxicology consultation if suspected ingestion/overdose
        -   For acute management contact Poison Control **800-222-1222**
-   Treatment of Secondary Complications
    -   Infection: abx only if progressing HE, signs of infection, or
        development of SIRS; ppx abx do not reduce mortality
    -   Cerebral edema/increased ICP:  elevated HOB to 30 degrees, quiet
        and dimly lit room, minimize IVF, goal Na 145-155,
        hyperventilation if concern for impending herniation. Consider
        3% saline (500mL) and/or mannitol (1g/kg, 20%) for pt at highest
        risk (serum ammonia >150, grade III/IV HE, ARF, vasopressor
        support
    -   Seizures: phenytoin (no evidence to support seizure ppx)
    -   Renal Failure: early CRRT if persistent Metabolic Acidosis,
        Volume Overload, Hyperammonemia, falling UOP
    -   Coagulopathy: IV Vit K; products for invasive procedures or
        active bleeding only
-   Additional Supportive Care
    -   PPI for bleeding ppx
    -   Enteral nutrition within 2-3 days; avoid TPN if possible; avoid
        NG feeds if progressive HE; NG should only be placed w/
        intubation as gagging increases ICP
    -   Prefer propofol for sedation for better neuro exams and may reduce cerebral blood flow

## Specific Management by Etiology:

- Acetaminophen
    - Early toxicology consultation if suspected ingestion/overdose
    - For acute management contact Poison Control 800-222-1222
    - Activated charcoal within 4 hours of ingestion, most effective within 1 hour
    - IV N-acetylcysteine per protocol, look up Rumack-Matthew Nomogram and consult with toxicology
        - In Epic: search “N-acetylcysteine” and select order set “Acetaminophen overdose”
- AFLP/HELLP – delivery

- Amanita phalloides – IV fluid resuscitation, PO charcoal, IV penicillin, IV acetylcysteine

- Autoimmune – IV steroids following approval by hepatology (and typically post biopsy). Azathioprine generally deferred until cholestasis resolved (Mycophenolate can be used instead)

- Budd-Chiari – anticoagulation, IR-guided endovascular therapy, transplant (must rule out underlying malignancy and evaluate for thrombotic disorders)

- HAV/HEV – supportive care, consider ribavirin for ALF due to HEV

- HBV – nucleos(t)ide analogue; orthotopic liver transplant

- HSV – acyclovir
