## Background

- 6401 vs. 6404

    - "6401": process to detain someone who has a high likelihood of
        posing harm to themselves or others *due to mental illness*. Purpose
        is short-term detention until a prompt psychiatric assessment can be
        performed

        - One person completes this. Can be law enforcement officers,
            psychologists, physicians

        - Must document justification for why the hold is needed (progress
            note, assessment form, etc)

    - "6404": 6404= Certificate of Need. Legal document used for emergency
        involuntary psychiatric admission

        - Pt must have mental illness or serious emotional disturbance
            (excluding intellectual/developmental disabilities) and pose an
            immediate substantial likelihood of serious harm because of this
            based on a face-to face assessment by a qualified psychiatric
            professional

            - Treatment must be necessary for symptom reduction and lack
                of treatment would lead to deterioration, with no less
                drastic alternative to inpatient hospitalization

        - Two certificates needed: the first to transport a patient to a
            psychiatric facility and the second for an involuntary admission

        - Two different *qualified persons* must each complete a form

            - Psychiatry residents can write these due to their special
                training licenses

- No AMA Medical Hold: used when a patient does not have capacity to
    leave the hospital against medical advice *due to a medical
    condition* and needs to remain in the hospital

    - Can be ordered by any physician Medical Hold Order Set

## VUH specific procedures

- A physical copy of the first 6404 is required to accompany the
    patient when they are transported to a psychiatric facility after
    medical discharge. The form is completed by the psychiatry team
