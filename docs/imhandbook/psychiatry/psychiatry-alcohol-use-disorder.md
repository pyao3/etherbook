# Alcohol Use Disorder 

Barrington Hwang, Kristopher Kast

## Background

- 50% of hospitalized pts drink alcohol; at-risk alcohol use is \>14
    drinks/week or \>5 drinks in a sitting (for men; for women and men
    \>65, 7 per week, \>4 per sitting)

- Alcohol withdrawal onset occurs 6-12 hours after last drink, with
    90% having non-severe course; CIWA score \<10 at 24-48 hours
    indicates low risk of worsening symptoms

- Risk of seizures greatest at 12-24 hrs, occurring in \~3% of pts;
    risk of delirium greatest at 48-72 hrs, occurring in \~5%

- Risk assessment

   - RF: prior seizures/delirium, co-substance use (especially
      benzodiazepines), no abstinent days in past month, presenting BAL
      \>200, dysautonomia

   - CIWA symptom-triggered protocol appropriate for pts at low risk of
      severe withdrawal

   - For non-low risk pts, consider benzodiazepine/barbiturate load and
      standing taper;

- Indications for admission: prior severe withdrawal (withdrawal
    seizures or delirium), comorbidities (medical and psychiatric
    illness), pregnancy, significant impairment in social/occupational
    functioning, communication barriers, social barriers

## Presentation

- Acute intoxication: disinhibition, slurred speech, ataxia, nystagmus

- Acute Withdrawal: nausea, vomiting, anxiety, agitation, audio-visual
    and tactile hallucinations, headache, diaphoresis, fine motor tremor
    while arms and fingers outstretched, autonomic hyperactivity

- Chronic heavy use: Sequelae of chronic liver disease & malnutrition,
    including thiamine deficiency

- Caine criteria for Wernicke’s encephalopathy:

    - 2 or more: (1) malnutrition, (2) ataxia, (3) oculomotor
      abnormalities, (4) AMS

## Evaluation

- Identify last use, quantity per day/week, other sedative-hypnotic
    use, history of withdrawal, social/occupational dysfunction, other
    toxic forms of alcohol compounds including methanol, ethylene glycol

- Acute Alcohol Withdrawal

    - Labs: Blood alcohol level, urine toxicology (+/- ethyl glucuronide
      to detect use in prior 3 days), BMP, CBC, HFTs (AST:ALT elevation
      2:1), CK and β - hCG

    - CIWA score quantifies severity, though subject to inflation by
      subjective symptoms

# Management

## Acute Alcohol Withdrawal

- Most patients are appropriate for diazepam-based protocols:

  - CIWA-based symptom-triggered for low-risk patients

  - Diazepam load + standing taper for non-low risk patients

- Substitute lorazepam for pts with hepatic impairment (risk of
    long-acting accumulation)

- Benzodiazepine resistance: likely due to poor cross-tolerance, these
    pts require phenobarbital load ( 8-12 mg/kg (up to 15 mg/kg) divided
    into 3 doses 3 hours apart)

- Add folate, multivitamin, and electrolyte repletion

- If \>2 Caine criteria, treat empirically for Wernicke’s
    encephalopathy with high-dose IV thiamine (500 mg TID IV x 3-5 days)

- Consider Addiction Psychiatry consultation for complex presentations

## Alcohol Use Disorder

- After withdrawal stabilization, engage pt in discussion around use
    and educate on connection between use and presenting medical
    problems

- All patients with AUD should be initiated on pharmacotherapy (MAUD)
    prior to discharge to mitigate risk of relapse, if consistent with
    patient’s goals

- Additional psychosocial treatments effective for AUD include 12-step
    groups (AA, SMART Recovery), cognitive behavioral therapy, sober
    living facilities, family therapy, contingency management, and
    IOP/residential facilities

- If patient does not have abstinence goal, reduced or controlled
    drinking may allow for harm reduction; naltrexone and topiramate
    have evidence for non-abstinence outcomes

- Pharmacologic Interventions:

    - Naltrexone (cannot be on opioid agonist):

        - Need 7-10 days since last opioid before starting

        - 25 mg x1 day, then titrate up to 50 mg daily; also available in
            q30d IM

        - Monitor liver enzymes; AST/ALT must be \< 3-5x ULN

    - Acamprosate (cannot be used in severe renal impairment)

        - Head-to-head, inferior to naltrexone (see COMBINE trial)

        - 333 mg TID, titrating to 666 mg TID dosing

    - Disulfiram

        - Infrequently used outside of extreme motivation (e.g.
            professional under monitoring); would not use outside specialist
            care

        - Must abstain from alcohol \~2 weeks after last dose, given risk
            of disulfiram-ethanol reaction (DER), which can be fatal
            depending upon disulfiram and ethanol doses

    - Topiramate

        - Not FDA-approved for AUD, but has significant supporting
            evidence

        - Useful for individuals without abstinence goal

        - Titrate slowly over 8 weeks to 200-300 mg/d

    - Gabapentin

        - Not FDA-approved for AUD, but with some evidence

        - Useful for post-acute withdrawal anxiety, insomnia, or
            co-occurring neuropathy

        - Titrate to 900-1800 mg/d divided into TID dosing, monitoring for
            sedation

        - Risk of sedation/apnea if concomitant alcohol use
