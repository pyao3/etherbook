# Inpatient Insomnia

## Background

- Sleep disturbances in the hospital are multifactorial

- Consequences of sleep disturbances include changes in cognition,
    behavior, anxiety, pain perception, respiratory function,
    inflammation, and metabolism

- Goals while inpatient: optimize sleep environment, minimize
    stimulating or sleep-related side effects of concomitant
    medications, utilize non-pharmacologic strategies

## Management

- Non-pharmacologic interventions:

    - Noise reduction: (ear protection, white noise, etc.)

    - Keeps lights on during the day and off at night

    - Reducing nighttime interruptions: Retime VS checks and lab draws

    - Minimize devices (ex: telemetry) and lines as able

- Pharmacotherapy:

    - Minimize medications such as sedatives/hypnotics, opioids,
        glucocorticoids, beta blockers, and certain antibiotics that disturb
        sleep architecture

    - Melatonin: 1-5 mg PO qhs

        - First-line choice based on mild side-effect profile, low
            potential for drug-drug interactions, and improves circadian
            rhythms; Dose 2-3hrs before bedtime

    - Trazodone: 25-50 mg PO qhs (max 200 mg/day)

        - Side effects: headache, dry mouth, and nausea

        - Monitor for orthostasis and infrequent atrial arrhythmias; use
            lowest effective dose

    - Mirtazapine: 7.5-15 mg PO qHS

        - A primary alpha-2 antagonist with 5-HT2 and H1 antagonism

        - Consider when insomnia appears to be related to primary
            depression

        - Can increase appetite and cause weight gain

## Additional Information

- Avoid the following in the inpatient setting:

    - Benzodiazepines

        - Reduces sleep latency and increases total sleep time but avoided
            due to significant adverse effects: respiratory depression,
            cognitive decline, delirium, daytime sleepiness, and falls,
            particularly in hospitalized older adults

    - Non-benzodiazepines benzodiazepine receptor agonists (e.g.,
        zolpidem, eszopiclone/zopiclone, zaleplon)

        - Commonly used in the outpatient setting but associated with
            cognitive dysfunction, delirium, and falls in hospitalized
            patients

    - Diphenhydramine

        - Trials evaluating their effectiveness as sleep aids are limited
            and show mixed results

        - Many potential side effects that are enhanced in the inpatient
            setting: impaired cognition, anticholinergic effects
            (constipation, urinary retention)
