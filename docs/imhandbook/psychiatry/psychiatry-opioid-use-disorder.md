# Opioid Use Disorder 

Rita Hurd, David Marcovitz

--- 

## Background

- Standard of care is opioid stabilization with buprenorphine or
    methadone (in OUD) or other full agonist opioids (in chronic opioid
    therapy)

- Methadone and buprenorphine can be ordered by any physician for
    inpatients

- Maintenance agonist therapy should be offered to every patient, with
    preference for an “opt-out” approach (even for uninsured patients
    through state grant funding)

## Presentation (Withdrawal)

- Restlessness/psychomotor activation, anxiety, irritability, nausea,
    abdominal cramping, loose stool, diffuse musculoskeletal pain,
    chills, insomnia, yawning

- Pupillary dilation, piloerection, tearing, nasal congestion,
    diaphoresis, restless legs

## Evaluation

- Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS): quantifies severity of
    opioid withdrawal and allows for safer buprenorphine inductions

- Asking about opioid exposure: “You’re uncomfortable. I work with a
    lot of people in the hospital, and some come with regular exposure
    to opioids from a lot of different places (their doctors, friends),
    should we be treating any withdrawal for you?”

# Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD)

## Buprenorphine

- Partial agonist at the mu opioid receptor with high binding affinity

- Long half-life (24-36 hours) allows for daily dosing

- TID dosing is more effective for acute pain (as the analgesic effect
    is shorter-lived)

- OK to use in renal failure/HD; may reduce dose in hepatic injury

- All non-pregnant pts should receive buprenorphine-naloxone (e.g.
    Suboxone) formulations to mitigate risk of diversion/injection

- Induction:

  - Hold all opioid medication 12+ hours prior to first buprenorphine
      dose (typically, this opioid-free period is overnight from 9 PM to 9
      AM), with a recorded COWS score \>8-10;

  - 4 mg is given SL, monitoring for oversedation; additional 4 mg is
      given in 1 hour, and final 4 mg at 4 hours (total of 12 mg in first
      day)

      - Only sedation or hypopnea should prevent a full 12 mg dose

  - Typical starting dose: 12-16 mg/day

- Maintenance: 4-32 mg daily; 16mg and above to suppress opioid use

  - Requires waivered-provider

- Acute Pain Management in pts using Buprenorphine:

  - There is no contraindication to full-agonist opioid analgesia for
      breakthrough pain

      - If the etiology of pts pain would require opioid therapy in a
          non-OUD patient, do not avoid opioids; these may be used safely
          in the hospital

  - Peri-operative pain management: continue buprenorphine at reduced
      and split doses (4 mg BID or TID); will prevent withdrawal and
      cravings, but NOT manage new pain

  - Post-operatively: reduce opioid requirements and increase
      buprenorphine to home dose

      - If buprenorphine was discontinued, will require induction
          procedure

## Methadone

- Full mu opioid agonist with additional NMDA-receptor activity

- Better option for individuals who cannot tolerate the buprenorphine
    induction procedure, with significant chronic or escalating pain

  - Long t1/2: 12-36 hrs; max 10 mg/d q7d, to prevent dose-stacking and
      delayed overdose

- Safe in renal failure; dose reduction for hepatic injury

- Potential for QT prolongation at higher doses, warrants QTc
    monitoring

- Induction:

  - In the hospital, start at 10 mg TID, holding doses for sedation or
      hypopnea; lower doses if concerned for respiratory compromise or
      concurrent CNS depressant therapy

  - Limit 40 mg in first 24 hours; then titrate 5 mg/d q3d while
      admitted

- Maintenance:

  - Must confirm dose with methadone clinic before restarting outpatient
      dose; until then, do not give more than initial doses (30 mg in
      single dose, 40 mg in first 24 hours)

  - After confirming home dose, continue as single daily dose

## Naltrexone

- Mu opioid antagonist; Half-life oral \~4 hours but clinically active
    \~24 hrs

- IM maintains clinically effective levels up to 30 days

- High affinity for mu receptor --\> CAN precipitate withdrawal
    requiring 7-10 days opioid abstinence prior to initiation

- If due for monthly injection while admitted, may substitute oral
    formulation until discharged to outpatient provider to receive
    injection

## Additional Information

- Psychosocial Interventions that complement MOUD:

  - Consider referral to SUD counseling, mutual help (self-help,
      12-step, AA), intensive outpatient, and short- or long-term
      residential treatment

- Use of other drugs NOT a contraindication to MOUD, however should
    encourage abstinence from other drugs during therapy (especially
    benzodiazepines)

- Prescribe intranasal naloxone for overdose prevention to all OUD
    patients discharging from hospital, regardless of MOUD status
