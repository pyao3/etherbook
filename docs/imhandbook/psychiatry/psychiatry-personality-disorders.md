Personality Disorders – Jonathan Constant, Jonathan Smith

Background

-   Caring for pts with personality disorder symptoms can result in pt
    and provider frustration, delays in treatment and at times,
    sub-optimal care and AMA discharges
-   An understanding of personality disorders can mitigate some of these
    barriers
-   How do personality disorders develop?
    -   Genetic/temperament component, early traumatizing and shaping
        experiences
    -   Development of maladaptive perceptions and responses to other
        individuals
    -   Pathological interaction styles and response to stressors (fear
        of abandonment, dependence, rejection) are developed and become
        self-fulfilling and re-enforced leading to pervasive
        interpersonal difficulties

Presentation

-   Borderline Personality Disorder:
    -   Unstable and intense relationships; “splitting” between
        idealization and devaluation
    -   Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment
    -   Impulsivity: substance use, binge eating, reckless behavior
    -   Recurrent suicidal behavior or gestures
    -   Mood instability: quick onset and short-lived intense dysphoria,
        irritability, anxiety
    -   Difficulty controlling anger (displays of temper, aggression)
-   Narcissistic Personality Disorder:
    -   Grandiosity: exaggerates achievements and expects to be
        recognized as superior
    -   Preoccupied with unlimited power, success, brilliance
    -   Sense of entitlement: expects favorable treatment and compliance
        with expectations
    -   Exploits others and lacks empathy
-   Antisocial personality disorder:
    -   Failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful
        behavior
    -   Deceitfulness, lying, conning others for personal profit or
        pleasure
    -   Impulsivity and reckless disregard for others
    -   Irritability, aggressiveness and lack of remorse

Management

-   Consult Psychiatry
-   Create a behavioral plan
    -   Outline the pt, as well as the team’s, responsibilities and
        goals of care with identification of the concerning behavior and
        a firm plan for if the agreement is broken
    -   Ideally, the pt should sign this plan and consider it as a
        contract
    -   Dot Phrase/Sample:
        .IMBehavioralPlan (go to dot phrases under user Joseph Quintana)
        -   Adjust, add and remove content based on patient
-   Behavioral interventions:
    -   Aim for consistency w/ providers & nursing; limit consultants to
        ↓
        splitting behaviors
    -   Acknowledge pt's grievance/frustrations and shift focus on how
        to solve the problem
    -   Align goals by emphasizing common ground and find ways to make
        small concessions
    -   Be aware of progress and know when to disengage (if behaviors
        are escalating)
    -   Monitor countertransference (the emotions the pt is eliciting in
        the provider): irresponsible and child-like behavior may prompt
        the provider to become angry or act in ways to limit the pt's
        control in their care, further perpetuating the behavior
-   Gold standard = Psychotherapy
    -   Dialectical Behavioral therapy, Cognitive behavioral therapy,
        Psychodynamic
    -   If the patient is willing, SW should assist with establishing at
        discharge
-   Pharmacotherapy **:**
    -   Unclear benefit in pharmacological management of Personality
        Disorder
    -   Treatment of comorbid psychiatric disorders if present would be
        most appropriate
