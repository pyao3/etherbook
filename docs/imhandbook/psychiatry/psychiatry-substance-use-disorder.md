# Substance Use Disorder (SUD)

## Background

- SUDs are common, complex, and chronic neuropsychiatric disorders
    with well-described inherited risk, dysregulated neurophysiology,
    and multiple effective treatment modalities

- Pts w/SUD face significant stigma, prior traumatic experiences in
    healthcare environments

    - Using the term “abuse” undermines the disease model of addiction

    - Person-centered, specific terminology: “person with opioid and
        alcohol use disorders”

- Avoid the qualifier “Polysubstance.” Instead, clarify specific
    diagnoses for each substance category

- DSM 5 Criteria (same for most substance categories): Requires 2+
    criteria met in past year; use must cause clinically significant
    impairment and/or distress:

    - Loss of control – larger amounts, longer time, ongoing use despite
        consequences, efforts/desire to reduce use

    - Physiologic changes -- tolerance, withdrawal (these 2 alone do not
        necessarily imply a disorder if they result from prescribed
        therapy), craving

    - Consequences – hazardous use, interpersonal problems, medical
        problems, failed role obligations, lost activities

## General Management:

- First priority in the inpatient medical setting is to identify and
    stabilize withdrawal states

    - Mitigate risks of severe sequelae (seizure, delirium)

    - Avoid unintended iatrogenic harm (ex: opioid abstinence leading to
        lost tolerance and post-discharge overdose)

    - Avoid distress-driven AMA discharge

- Consider Addiction Psychiatry consultation for management of complex
    withdrawal states, substance use disorders and co-occurring
    psychiatric diagnoses, assistance with risk stratification for
    hospital misuse and/or hospital discharge with PICC lines for
    outpatient antibiotics, and differentiation of pain requiring opioid
    therapy and opioid use disorder

- If in the emergency room and not admitted, consult PAS
