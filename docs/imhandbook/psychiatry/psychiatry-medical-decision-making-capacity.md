## Background

- Capacity is a patient’s ability to make a specific medical decision
    at a specific point in time and can be assessed by any physician

- Competency: “global decision-making capacity,” a legal determination
    made by a judge

## Four key components to assess medical decision-making capacity

1.  Choice: patient must clearly indicate a consistent choice

- “Have you decided whether to follow the recommendation for the
    treatment?”

- “Can you tell me what your decision is?”

2.  Understand: Patient must grasp the fundamental meaning of the
    > information communicated by the medical team

- “Please tell me in your own words what you were told about:

    - The problem with (1) your health now and (2) the recommended
        treatment

    - The risks/benefits of (3) treatment, (4) alternative treatments
        and (5) no treatment”

3.  Appreciate: the medical condition and likely consequences of
    > treatment options

- “What do you believe is wrong with your health now?”

- “What is treatment likely to do for you?”

- “What do you believe will happen if you’re not treated”

- “Why do you think this treatment was recommended?”

4.  Reason: patient must rationally manipulate relevant information

- “What makes the chosen option better than the alternative?”

- “How did you decide to accept or reject the recommended treatment?”

If the patient does not have medical decision-making capacity:

- Identify and remedy cause of impairment if possible (if decision is
    non-urgent)

- Identify surrogate decision maker

## Documenting medical decision-making capacity:

- Use a dot phrase .Capacity that lists the four components and
    document your thought process citing evidence from your interview
