## Background

- Definition: acute fluctuating disturbance of attention and awareness
    due to an underlying medical condition

- Presentation: deficits in attention, orientation, or memory;
    hallucinations or delusions; sleep-wake disturbances; psychomotor
    changes (hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed); language impairment;
    and/or emotional lability (agitation)

     - Think about the ABCâ€™s of Delirium

          - Affect (anxiety, paranoia, irritability, apathy, mood shifts,
              personality changes)

          - Behavior (hallucinations, restlessness or agitation, psychomotor
              abnormalities, sleep disturbances)

          - Cognition (impaired memory, disorientation, disturbances in
              speech)

## Evaluation

- Use screening tools to assess for delirium: Brief Confusion
    Assessment Method (bCAM). See critical care section for the ICU
    version, CAM-ICU

   ![approach to delirium](../images/image28.png)

- Once delirium is diagnosed, evaluate for the underlying cause.
    Delirium has many etiologies and may occur alone or in combination
    (in \~10% of cases, no clear cause is found)

    - Mnemonic for common causes of delirium:

        - D- Drugs/toxins (use of benzodiazepines, opiates,
            anticholinergics, steroids, etc., withdrawal from ETOH, benzos,
            etc.)

        - E- Eyes/ears (sensory deficits)

        - L- Low perfusion states (MI, PE, heart failure, sepsis)

        - I- Infection

        - R- Retention (urine, stool)

        - I- Intracranial events (trauma, seizure, stroke, hemorrhage)

        - U- Undernutrition/dehydration

        - M- Metabolic, endocrine (Hypo or hyper Na, hyperCa, uremia,
            thyroid, hypoglycemia)

    - See neurology chapter for approach and work-up to AMS in general

## Management

- Treat underlying cause as above

- See critical care section for prevention in the ICU (ABCDEF bundle)

- Cognitive impairment or disorientation: provide clock, calendar, and
    appropriate lighting. Regular reorientation. Provide cues from a
    familiar environment (pictures, calls or visits from family members)

- Encourage mobilization

- Review medications, eliminate sedatives and anticholinergics as able
    (review agents on Beers Criteria medication list)

- Remove medical support devices as able (foley catheters, telemetry)

- Maintain normal sleep-wake cycle. Keep lights on in the day and
    avoid excessive naps

- Ensure adequate bowel regimen and hydration

- Assess for pain and treat appropriately

- Ensure hearing aids, glasses, and dentures are available

- Note on pharmacologic management: There is no pharmacologic
    intervention known to prevent or treat of delirium. Reserve for
    agitation impairing patient safety when non-pharmacologic
    interventions alone are unsuccessful. See agitation section for
    medication approach
