# Asthma

## Background

- Typically diagnosed in childhood, but occupational asthma,
    aspirin-induced asthma and eosinophilic asthma are more commonly
    diagnosed in adults
- Three most common symptoms: wheezing after trigger, nighttime cough,
    and associated dyspnea
- COPD-asthma overlap syndromes: newer entity that typically involves
    intermittent symptoms
    - Obstruction is present but does not fully resolve with
        bronchodilator
    - Consider this diagnosis in a pt w/significant smoking history who is
        dx’d with asthma at age >40yo

## Evaluation

- Ask about triggers: cold, exercise, URIs, allergens, inhaled
        irritants
- Ask about family history or personal history of atopy, eczema,
        allergic rhinitis
- Exam: wheezing, prolonged expiratory phase; nasal polyps, rhinitis,
        eczema
- Spirometry (PFT’s) with reversible obstruction
    - FEV1/FVC <0.7; FEV1 12% and 200 mL after bronchodilator
- “All That Wheezes Is Not Asthma”. Must rule out alternative
        diagnoses:
    - Panic attacks, upper airway obstruction, foreign body, vocal cord
        dysfunction, CHF (cardiac asthma), COPD, ILD
- Consider CBC w/diff to screen for significant anemia and
    eosinophilia (associated w/allergic asthma or eosinophilic
    pneumonia)
- If concerned for allergic asthma or allergic bronchopulmonary
    aspergillosis, consider measuring total serum IgE levels

### Classify Severity and Assess for Symptom Control with the RULE OF 2s

- Does the patient have symptoms or require rescue inhaler ≥2 times
    per week?
- Does the patient endorse nighttime symptoms ≥ 2 times per month?
- Does the patient have to refill rescue inhaler ≥ 2 times per year?
- Does the patient ever have to limit activity due to asthma symptoms?

### Initial Assessment of Severity

- Intermittent: No to all of the above and FEV1> 80% predicted. Start
    at step 1
- Persistent: Yes to any question above. Start at Step 2
    - Mild: Less than daily symptoms, less than weekly nighttime symptoms,
        minor limitation to activities. FEV >80% predicted
    - Moderate: Daily symptoms, weekly nighttime symptoms, some limitation
        to activities. FEV 60-80% predicted
    - Severe: More severe symptoms than above, FEV1 <60% predicted
    - Consider referral to pulmonary

## Management

- Aim to use the lowest possible step to maintain symptom control.
    Also consider stepping down therapy if pt has been well-controlled
    for >3 months
- Prior to escalating therapy, consider:
    - Adherence to therapy (including inhaler technique), uncontrolled
        comorbidities (allergies, GERD, OSA, etc), and alternative diagnoses
    - Ensure patients receive MDI and spacer teaching for full effect
- Updated Guidelines: prn ICS - LABA > prn SABA Step 1 (mild
    intermittent) and Step 2 (mild persistent)
    - Reduces exacerbations, easier to schedule does in future if needed
    - SYGMA Trial showed rescue/prn Budesonide-formoterol (ICS - LABA)
        non-inferior to daily ICS-LABA + prn SABA in preventing
        exacerbations
- Follow-up
    - Repeat PFTs q3-6 mos after beginning therapy and q1-2 yrs thereafter
    - Regular follow up at least q6 mos for all patients with asthma

## VA specific guidance

- Mometasone is the formulary ICS and Wixela (fluticasone-salmeterol)
    is the formulary ICS/LABA
- Ordering PFTs: Refer to Pulm section on PFTs for VUMC and VA
    specifics
- Please see above text for updated guidance on using prn ICS – LABA
    for step 1/step 2
