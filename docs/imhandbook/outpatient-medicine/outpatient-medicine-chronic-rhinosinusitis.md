# Chronic Rhinosinusitis

## Background

- Inflammatory syndrome of the paranasal sinuses, with objective
    evidence of inflammation for \> 12 weeks, typically in young to
    middle aged adults

- Symptoms: typically need two of the following:

  - Anterior/posterior mucopurulent nasal drainage

  - Presence of nasal fullness/congestion

  - Facial pain/pressure, sometimes accompanied by headache (most
      prevalent but least specific)

  - Reduction in sense of smell

- Red flag symptoms that require more emergent evaluation by ENT or
    NSGY

  - Double vision

  - Proptosis

  - Ophthalmoplegia

  - Severe headache

  - Any focal neurologic deficits

- In addition to clinical history, patients need objective evaluation
    with nasal endoscopy or non-contrasted CT of sinuses (gold standard
    imaging modality) to confirm presence of inflammation and presence
    of nasal polyps

- Other conditions to consider on differential:

  - Rhinitis without sinusitis (vasomotor, gustatory, allergic,
      idiopathic)

  - Headache and facial pain syndromes

  - Laryngopharyngeal reflux syndrome

## Management

- Daily sinus rinses with saline can clear sinuses of secretions,
    irritants and allergens

- Utilizing daily intranasal corticosteroid sprays improve symptoms,
    better control when used in conjunction with sprays

- Short courses of macrolide antibiotics less than 3 weeks duration
    along with short course oral corticosteroids for acute exacerbations

- When to refer to specialist:

  - ENT: Refractory symptoms necessitating rhinoscopy to look for nasal
      polyps, anatomical source of obstruction, ability to get direct
      culture from sinuses, or for sinus surgery as treatment

  - Allergy/immunology: treatment of causal allergen or associated
      immunodeficiency that contributes to recurrent infections

- 10-14 days of oral corticosteroids can also help in patients with
    nasal polyps shrink inflamed tissue and decrease obstructive
    symptoms but require ongoing nasal steroids to prevent recurrence

- Daily antileukotriene agents and antihistamines can provide benefit
    in patients with an allergic component

    Smoking cessation can lead to symptom relief in CRS pts with and w/o
    nasal polyps
