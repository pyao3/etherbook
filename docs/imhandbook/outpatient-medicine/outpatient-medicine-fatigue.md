# Fatigue

## Background

- 21-33% of primary care patients describe fatigue as an important
    problem (even if not CC)
- Obtain a thorough history and validate the patient's concerns
  - Assess impact on daily life and accommodations the patient has made
      to cope
- Description of fatigue: mental vs. physical; sleepiness/tiredness
    vs. "low energy"
- Assess Chronicity: Acute <1 month; subacute 1-6 months; Chronic >6
    months
- Review medication list, age -elated cancer screening, prior lab
    values, imaging findings if applicable
- Brief Fatigue Inventory or Fatigue Assessment Scale can be used for
    quantification

## Common Etiologies

| System                 | Differential                                                                                                                                    |

| Hematologic/Neoplastic | Anemia, occult malignancy                                                                                                                       |
| Infectious Disease     | HIV, Mononucleosis, Hepatitis, other viral, TB, fungal, parasitic                                                                               |
| Medication Use         | Opioids, benzodiazepines, antihistamines, muscle relaxants, anti-depressants, beta-blockers, GABA analogues, substance use (ETOH, THC, Cocaine) |
| Psychological          | Depression, anxiety, somatization disorder, dysthymia                                                                                           |

## Evaluation

- Complete physical exam
- Lab tests to order if >1 month duration: CMP, CBC w/ diff, HIV,
    Hepatitis B/C, TSH
  - Autoimmune, inflammatory, pregnancy, CK, PPD tests based on
      clinical context
- Assess for mood disorder (PHQ-9; GAD7)
- Assess for sleep disturbance (STOP-BANG, Epworth Sleepiness Scale)
- Age appropriate cancer screening if applicable
- Diagnostic imaging studies based on history and physical exam
    findings
- Screen for domestic violence, housing insecurity, substance use

## Management

- Treatment is largely specific to underlying etiology of fatigue (if
    found)
- Etiology may never be identified
  - Consider diagnosis of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue
      syndrome (ME/CFS) if other causes have been ruled out
- Continue a supportive relationship with patient
- Consider empiric trial of antidepressant therapy in those with
    residual/idiopathic fatigue with depressed mood even if patient does
    not meet MDD criteria
