## Background

- Large vessel vasculitis (aorta and its major branches)

    - Takayasu arteritis:

        - Most commonly <30 years old, 80-90% cases in females, greatest
            prevalence in Asia

        - Branches of aorta/aortic arch (subclavian, innominate, carotid
            arteries)

    - Giant cell Arteritis:

        - Most commonly >50 years old, slight F > M predominance

        - Cranial arteries (temporal artery), aorta and its branches

- Medium vessel vasculitis (muscular arteries that supply visceral
    organs)

    - Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN):

        - Most often middle age/older adults (peaks in 5th decade of life)

        - Necrotizing vasculitis of muscular arteries (renal, mesenteric,
            arteries supplying neurons and skin)

    - Kawasaki’s: not addressed here- most often children

- Small Vessel Vasculitis (arterioles, capillaries, and venules)

    - ANCA-associated vasculitis:

        - GPA: granulomatous; classically involves nasopharynx, lungs, kidneys

        - MPA: affects multiple organs but predilection for lungs and kidneys; in contrast to GPA, no nasopharynx involvement or granulomas

        - EGPA: granulomatous; predilection for heart and lungs; associated with eosinophilia, chronic rhinosinusitis, asthma; uncommon \> 65 years old

- Immune-complex vasculitis: not addressed here

    - Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis (see lab section)

    - IgA vasculitis

    - Anti-GBM disease

## Takayasu's Arteritis

### Presentation

- Subacute constitutional symptoms (fevers, arthralgias, myalgias,
    rash, weight loss), limb claudication, neuro symptoms from
    carotid/vertebral arteritis (vertigo, headaches, syncope, strokes),
    GI symptoms from mesenteric ischemia, angina from coronary arteritis

- HTN (renal artery involvement), discrepant BP between arms (arterial
    stenosis), diminished or absent pulses (“pulseless disease”),
    arterial bruits, carotidynia (tenderness of carotid artery)

### Evaluation

- ESR/CRP (often elevated, though can be normal during active disease)

- Arteriography: MRA or CTA of head/neck, chest, and abdomen/pelvis

### Management

- New arterial stenosis or aorta/carotid artery involvement: 1mg/kg
    prednisone daily (max 60-80mg) for 2-4 weeks followed by steroid
    taper

- Organ threatening disease (coronary artery involvement, critical
    stenosis of carotid/vertebral arteries): 500-1000mg IV
    methylprednisolone daily for 1-3 days, then 1mg/kg prednisone daily
    for 2-4 weeks followed by steroid taper

## Giant Cell Arteritis

### Presentation

- Always consider in pts \>50 years old with new headache, abrupt
    vision changes (diplopia, amaurosis fugax), jaw claudication,
    temporal artery tenderness

- Polymyalgia rheumatica will often accompany GCA; classically with
    bilateral shoulder and hip pain/stiffness (with elevated ESR, but
    normal CK)

### Evaluation

- ESR/CRP (almost always elevated), CK, TSH

- Evaluate for any temporal artery abnormalities (tenderness to
    palpation, presence of nodules)

- Ophthalmology evaluation if any concern for ocular involvement

- Temporal artery biopsy by vascular surgery

### Management

- Start glucocorticoids as soon as GCA is suspected, do not delay
    while awaiting biopsy

    - No vision loss: prednisone 1mg/kg daily (max 60 mg) for 2-4
        > weeks followed by steroid taper

    - Vision loss/diplopia: 500-1000mg IV methylprednisolone daily for
        > 3 days, followed by prednisone 1mg/kg daily (max 60mg) for 2-4
        > weeks followed by steroid taper  

## Polyarteritis Nodosa (PAN)

### Presentation

- Constitutional symptoms: fatigue, weakness, fevers, arthralgias,
    myalgias, rash, weight loss

- Evidence of multisystem involvement:

    - Asymmetric polyneuropathy with motor and sensory deficits (foot
        > drop, radial/ulnar neuropathy)

    - Skin manifestations: livedo reticularis, palpable purpura,
        > ulcers, tender erythematous nodules, bullae, vesicles

    - HTN (renal arteritis)

    - Abdominal pain and melena (mesenteric arteritis)

    - Ischemic cardiomyopathy (coronary arteritis)

    - Testicular pain (orchitis)

- Classically spares the lungs (consider other dx if pulmonary
    complaints)

### Evaluation

- ESR/CRP, CK, TSH

- Hepatitis panel (HBV/HCV can cause secondary PAN)

- Arteriography: MRI, CT, or angiogram with classic “string of pearls”
    appearance 

- Biopsy: segmental transmural inflammation of muscular arteries,
    fibrinoid necrosis of arterial wall (no granulomas, presence
    suggests another process)

### Management

- Mild disease (ex: isolated cutaneous disease): prednisone 1mg/kg
    daily (max 60-80mg) for 4 weeks followed by steroid taper

- Moderate disease: cyclophosphamide + prednisone 1mg/kg daily (max
    60-80mg) for 4 weeks followed by steroid taper

- Severe/life-threatening disease (renal failure, significant
    proteinuria, GI/cardiac/neurologic involvement): cyclophosphamide +
    500-1000mg IV methylprednisolone daily for 3 days, followed by
    prednisone 1mg/kg daily (max 60mg) for 4 weeks followed by steroid
    taper  

## Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)

### Presentation

- Constitutional symptoms (fevers, fatigue, weight loss) + evidence of
    glomerulonephritis (hematuria, proteinuria), upper respiratory tract
    involvement (nasal crusting, rhinorrhea, epistaxis, sinusitis), and
    pulmonary involvement (dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis)

- Less commonly affects eyes (scleritis), skin (palpable purpura), and
    peripheral nerves (mononeuritis multiplex)

### Evaluation

- ANCA + (typically PR3-cANCA)

- ESR/CRP, ANA, anti-GBM, C3/C4, cryoglobulins, HBV/HCV, HIV

- UA with microscopy (hematuria, proteinuria, RBC casts, dysmorphic
    RBCs)

- CT chest if pulmonary symptoms

- Biopsy: necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis, pauci-immune
    glomerulonephritis

- Clinical Pearl: If you suspect renal disease based (elevated Cr,
    hematuria) ask renal fellow or rheum fellow to help spin the urine
    to evaluate for RBC casting or dysmorphic cells. Quick way to
    confirm active GN, renal biopsy takes time to arrange

### Management

- Mild-moderate disease: MTX + prednisone 0.5 mg/kg/day followed by
    steroid taper

- Severe disease: rituximab or cyclophosphamide + prednisone
    1mg/kg/day (60-80mg max)

    - For pts with RPGN, pulmonary hemorrhage, mononeuritis multiplex,
        > or optic neuritis: IV methylprednisolone 7-15mg/kg/day (1000mg
        > max) x 3 days for induction therapy

- DVT ppx (high risk for DVT/PE)

## Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA)

### Presentation

- Similar to GPA, but without upper respiratory tract involvement;
    classically only involves lungs and kidneys

### Evaluation

- ANCA + (typically MPO-pANCA)

- ESR/CRP, ANA, anti-GBM, C3/C4, cryoglobulins, HBV/HCV, HIV

- UA with microscopy (hematuria, proteinuria, RBC casts, dysmorphic
    RBCs)

- CT chest if pulmonary symptoms

- Biopsy: necrotizing vasculitis (no granulomas), pauci-immune
    glomerulonephritis

### Management

- Same as GPA, see above

## Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA)

### Presentation

- Similar to GPA/MPA + atopic symptoms such as asthma (\>90%),
    rhinosinusitis, and peripheral eosinophilia

- Cardiac involvement (accounts for 50% deaths from EGPA): coronary
    arteritis, myocarditis, heart failure, arrhythmias

- Skin involvement (\>50%): tender subcutaneous nodules

### Evaluation

- ANCA + (typically MPO-pANCA), peripheral eosinophilia

- IgE, ANA, RF, C3/C4

- Biopsy: necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis, eosinophilic
    infiltrates with fibrinoid necrosis, pauci-immune glomerulonephritis

### Management

- Mild-moderate disease: prednisone 0.5-1 mg/kg/day for 6-12 weeks
    followed by steroid taper

- Severe disease: cyclophosphamide + prednisone 0.5-1 mg/kg/day for
    6-12 weeks followed by steroid taper

    - For pts with life-threatening multiorgan involvement (cardiac,
        > pulmonary, renal, neurologic): IV methylprednisolone 1000mg
        > daily x 3 days for induction therapy

- DVT ppx (high risk for DVT/PE)
