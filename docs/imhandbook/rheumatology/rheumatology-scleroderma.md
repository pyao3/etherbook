# Scleroderma (Systemic Sclerosis) 

Eva Niklinska and Raeann Whitney

---

Background

- Distinguish from localized scleroderma (morphea or linear
    scleroderma) = dermal fibrosis w/o internal organ involvement)

- 2 Major Subtypes of Generalized / Systemic Scleroderma (SSc):

    - Limited Cutaneous (lcSSc): skin thickening limited to the neck,
        face, or distal to elbows and knees; spares the truck and proximal
        extremities

        - Limited does not equal mild, limited refers to distribution of
            skin involvement

        - Renal crisis is rare

        - Patients with + ACA (anticentromere Ab) are at high risk for
            developing PAH

        - Patients with + Anti-Scl-70 Ab are also at high risk for
            progressive ILD

    - Diffuse Cutaneous: skin thickening extends proximal to the
        elbows/knees or trunk

        - Typically more abrupt onset and rapid progression compared to
            lcSSc

        - High risk for progressive ILD

        - \+ RNA polymerase III Ab = high risk of renal crisis, higher
            risk for malignancy

## Presentation

- CREST: Calcinosis cutis, Raynaud phenomenon, Esophageal dysmotility,
    Sclerodactyly, Telangiectasia (CREST syndrome is no longer a
    discrete diagnosis)

- Systemic: fatigue, weight loss

- Vascular: Raynaud’s +/- digital tip ulcers, telangiectasias,
    nailfold capillaroscopy w/ dilated capillary loops

- Skin: Loss of facial wrinkles, decreased oral aperture

- MSK: arthralgias, myalgias, flexion contractures

- GI: Esophageal or intestinal dysmotility, GERD, GAVE (watermelon
    stomach)

- Pulm: ILD (NSIP, UIP), pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)

- Cardiac: pericardial effusions, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy,
    conduction system disease

- Renal: renal crisis (onset of malignant HTN, greatest risk in first
    5 years)

## Evaluation

- 2013 ACR/EULAR Classification Criteria weight-based symptom

- Labs: ANA w/ Reflex, Scl70, anticentromere, RNA pol III (separate
    order in Epic)

- Imaging/Procedures: Baseline PFTs, Lung HRCT, TTE, EKG, 6-minute
    walk test

- Skin biopsy: Not often used for dx, may be required to differentiate
    other rare disorders (eosinophilic fasciitis, scleroderma,
    scleromyxedema)

## Management

- Organ-Based Symptomatic Therapy

    - Raynauds: CCB (amlodipine, nifedipine), topical nitroglycerin

    - GERD: PPI

    - Renal: Monitor BP; Cr

    - ILD: Periodic PFTs, monitor for new respiratory symptoms, pulm
        referral

    - Cardiac/PAH: annual TTE, cardiology referral

- Systemic Immunosuppression (if progressive skin thickening or organ
    involvement)

    - MTX, MMF, cyclophosphamide, if refractory rituximab, IVIG 

## Scleroderma Renal Crisis

- Typically presents early in disease course (can even precede skin
    thickening)

- Abrupt onset of hypertension and renal dysfunction

- Labs: Elevated Cr, proteinuria, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia,
    elevated renin

- Treatment: short acting ACE (captopril or enalapril, titratable),
    may require HD
