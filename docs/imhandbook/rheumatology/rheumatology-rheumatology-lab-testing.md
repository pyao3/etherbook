Serologic testing must be interpreted in the clinical context. ANA,
ANCA, and even specific antibodies without typical manifestations of the
disease are of unclear clinical significance

## Anti-nuclear Antibodies (ANA)

- Always send with reflex (if ≥ 1:80, will check for dsDNA, Sm, SSA,
    SSB, Scl70, RNP)

    - At VUMC, 1:80 is considered “positive”; a higher titer is more
        specific for ANA-associated rheumatologic disease

        - \~30% of the general population has a “positive” ANA at 1:40,
            most clinically significant ANAs are at least 1:160

- Common Patterns

    - Smooth/homogenous – associated with Anti-dsDNA and Anti-histone
        antibodies

    - Speckled – associated with Anti-RNP, Anti-Smith, Anti-SSA/Ro,
        Anti-SSB/La

    - Nucleolar – associated with Anti-Scl-70

- Specific types of ANAs:

    - Anti-dsDNA: High levels (\>150) are usually specific for SLE. Can
        correlate with disease activity, a/w renal disease

    - Anti-Smith (Qualitative): Very specific for SLE but not sensitive

    - Anti-SSA/Ro

        - Classic for Sjogren’s but non-specific; can also be seen in SLE,
            MCTD, myositis, etc

        - Maternal positivity for SSA is associated with congenital heart
            block in infants

    - Anti-SSB/La: Similar profile to Anti-SSA/Ro but less common

    - Anti-Scl-70: Specific for systemic sclerosis, most associated with
        diffuse cutaneous disease

    - Anti-RNP: Required for MCTD diagnosis, can also be seen in SLE

    - Anti-histone: drug-induced lupus

    - Anti-centromere: limited scleroderma, a/w pulmonary HTN

    - Anti-RNA polymerase III: increased risk of scleroderma renal disease

## Anti-neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies (ANCA)

- Qualitative: p-ANCA, c-ANCA, negative, or indeterminate

- Quantitative titers: anti-proteinase 3 (PR3), anti-myeloperoxidase
    (MPO) IgG antibodies

- See vasculitis section for further details

## C3 and C4

- Hypocomplementemia in active SLE (due to increased consumption)

- Complement may also be low in diseases that decreases the liver’s
    synthetic function

- ↓ C3/C4 in other diseases that form immune complexes, activating the
    classic complement pathway: mixed cryoglobulinemia, Sjogren’s, MPGN,
    and antiphospholipid syndrome

## C-reactive Protein (CRP) and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)

- Both tests are non-specific markers of inflammation

- CRP measures a specific acute phase protein made by the liver

    - IL-6 dependent (pts anti-IL6 therapy will have falsely decreased
        CRP)

    - Typically changes more rapidly than ESR as it is a direct measure of
        acute phase reactant

- ESR is the rate at which RBCs settle to the bottom of a test tube

    - Presence of positively charged proteins disrupt the self-repelling
        negative charges of RBCs clumping (rouleaux formation) increased
        rate of sedimentation

        - ESR will increase in states with increased antibodies, acute
            phase proteins, etc

    - Falsely low ESR: low fibrinogen states (DIC, HLH), sickle cell,
        polycythemia

## Creatinine Kinase (CK)

- CK can be elevated by vigorous exercise, rhabdomyolysis,
    endocrinopathy, cardiac disease, renal disease, malignancy,
    medication effect, neuromuscular disease, connective tissue disease

- Consider inflammatory myopathies if there is elevated CK and
    objective proximal muscle weakness

- Notably, CK is normal in polymyalgia rheumatica

## Extended Myositis Panel

- Ordered as “Myositis extended Pnl-ARUP”; includes 19 separate Abs

- Can be sent when suspecting various forms of myositis such as
    dermatomyositis, polymyositis, anti-synthetase syndrome (ex- ILD
    work-up)

## Cryoglobulins

- Cryoglobulins are immunoglobulins that spontaneously precipitate at
    low temperatures and become soluble again with rewarming

- Reported as qualitative (positive or negative) and quantitative
    (percentage = “cryocrit”)

    - Cryoglobulin last test is highly prone to collection error; must be
        collected in pre-warmed tubes and maintained at body temperature
        during collection and delivery to the lab;

    - At VUMC can only be obtained at certain times M-F; lab & nursing
        staff can coordinate

- Cryoglobulins are classified into three types: Type I, II, and III

    - Type I Cryoglobulins: Monoclonal immunoglobulins (IgM or IgG)

        - A/w lymphoproliferative disorders (Waldenström’s, MM, CLL, B
            cell lymphomas)

    - Types II and III are Mixed Cryoglobulins (they contain polyclonal
        components)

    - Essentially all mixed cryoglobulinemias will be RF+ \*

    - Commonly associated with HCV (\~90%); also CTD

    - Type II: *monoclonal* Ig with RF activity against *polyclonal* Igs

    - Type III: *polyclonal* Ig with RF against *polyclonal* Igs

        \*RF activity by definition is the reactivity of an IgM component
        with the Fc portion of an IgG
    
- Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis: small vessel vasculitis, vascular
        deposition of cryoprecipitates

    - Skin most common: palpable purpura, usually in lower extremities
        (colder areas), immune-complex mediated leukocytoclastic vasculitis
        on biopsy

    - Additional manifestations include: Arthralgias, peripheral motor or
        sensory neuropathy, sicca, glomerulonephritis (usually MPGN)
