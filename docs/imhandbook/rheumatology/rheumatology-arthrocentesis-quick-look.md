# Arthrocentesis Quick Look

## When in doubt, tap it!

- Send synovial fluid for Gram stain/culture and cell count

- Beware: Inflammatory / crystal arthropathies can have very high
    leukocyte counts!

    - The presence of crystals does NOT exclude septic arthritis

- A fever or concern for infection in a prosthetic joint is a surgical
    emergency; ortho will come in the middle of the night to tap a joint

- Contraindications to tap: overlying cellulitis or psoriatic plaque

    - Anticoagulation / DVT ppx is OK (no need to hold)

| ​Arthritis Type                  | Appearance ​          | Total WBC ​              | PMNs ​ |
|---------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|-------|
| Non-inflammatory ​               | Straw like / yellow ​ | \<2000​                  | \<25%​ |
| Inflammatory / Crystalopathies ​ | Yellow / cloudy ​     | \>2000​ (often 20-50K+)  | \>50%​ |
| Septic ​                         | Purulent ​            | \>50,000​ (often \>100K) | \>75%​ |

## Crystals

- Monosodium urate: needle-shaped, negatively birefringent

    - Sensitivity is generally good (\>90s%)


- Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate: rhomboid-shaped, positively
    birefringent (weakly)

    - Weak birefringence significantly reduced sensitivity
