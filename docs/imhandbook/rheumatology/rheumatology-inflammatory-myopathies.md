# Inflammatory Myopathies

## Background

- Inflammation and damage of skeletal muscle primarily leading to
    weakness

- Subtypes: Dermatomyositis, polymyositis, antisynthetase antibody
    syndrome associated myositis, immune-mediated necrotizing myositis,
    inclusion body myositis

- Additional myopathies: statin-induced myopathy, metabolic
    (hypothyroid, electrolyte), viral/infection myositis, diabetic
    myonecrosis

- Important point: PMR= painful, preserved strength vs inflammatory
    myopathy = painless weakness

- Hypomyopathic (or amyopathic) variants: skin and/or lungs are
    affected \>\> muscles

## Presentation

- Proximal, symmetric muscle weakness in upper and lower extremities
    in all but inclusion body myositis which is typically more distal
    and asymmetric

- Dermatomyositis: skin involvement can include heliotrope rash of
    upper eyelids, Gottron’s papules (on MCP, PIP), “mechanic’s hands,”
    and shawl sign

- Raynaud’s and arthralgias can also be present

## Evaluation

- Labs: BMP, TSH, CK level, anti Jo-1 antibody

- EMG: findings indicate myopathy

- MRI extremity/affected muscle group: muscle edema

- Skin biopsy in dermatomyositis: “interface dermatitis.”

- Muscle biopsy (do not do biopsy in same muscle as EMG done)

    - Polymyositis, inclusion body myositis: T cell mediated muscle injury

    - Dermatomyositis: immune complex/B cell mediated muscle injury

## Management

- Prednisone 1 mg/kg/day for 4-6 weeks with subsequent taper

- Consult Rheumatology

- MTX or AZA used if refractory to steroids, may need IVIG, rituximab

- If statin induced: stop statin or switch to lower intensity

- If dermatomyositis: evaluate for underlying malignancy
