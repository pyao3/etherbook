# Rheumatoid Arthritis 

Raeann Whitney

## Background

- Inflammation and proliferation of synovial tissue, loss of articular
    cartilage, erosion of juxtarticular bone

- Female predominant (\~3:1), mostly child-bearing age at onset

- Chronic, inflammatory polyarthritis affecting the small joints of
    the hands (MCPs, PIPs, classically spares DIPs), wrists, feet,
    ankles - typically *symmetric*

- Ulnar deviation, swan neck, boutonniere deformities are late
    findings of untreated disease

- Morning stiffness lasting \>30 min (often 1 hr+) suggests
    inflammatory arthritis (not specific)

- Extra-articular manifestations include: sicca symptoms, scleritis,
    ILD, pulm nodules, serositis, constrictive pericarditis, anemia,
    mononeuritis multiplex, rheumatoid nodules, rheumatoid vasculitis.
    Increased risk of lymphoma, osteoporosis

- C1-C2 instability: pts need evaluation with imaging prior to
    surgical procedure/intubation

## Evaluation

- Clinical diagnosis + positive RF, anti-CCP. Note up to 15-20%
    patients have seronegative RA

    - RF is more sensitive but not specific; can be + in HBV/HCV,
        cryoglobulinemia

    - CCP is less sensitive but more specific

- CBC, CMP, CRP, ESR, HIV, Hepatitis B and C screening; Quantiferon
    Gold (biologics)

- Obtain hand and foot films to assess for periarticular osteopenia &
    typical marginal erosions

## Management

- The majority of joint damage occurs early in the disease so early
    treatment paramount

- DMARDs: typically start with MTX; may require biologics such as TNF
    inhibitors

    - MTX dosed weekly; required daily 1 mg folic acid supplement

        - Toxicities: oral ulcers, bone marrow suppression, liver
            toxicity, pneumonitis, teratogenic (contraception required)

- Symptomatic/Flare treatment (no impact on disease progression):

- Steroids at low-moderate dosage (e.g., prednisone 15-20mg/day);
    NSAIDs (high doses required for anti-inflammatory effects)
