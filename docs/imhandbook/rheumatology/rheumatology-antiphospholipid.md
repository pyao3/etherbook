# Anti-Phospholipid Syndrome

## Background

- Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs) = a heterogenous group of
    autoantibodies which interact with endothelial cells through binding
    of β2GPI receptor

- APLs induce a procoagulant and proinflammatory endothelial phenotype
    arterial, venous, small vessel thromboembolic events, or pregnancy
    losses

## Presentation

- Unexplained/recurrent venous, arterial, and/or small vessel
    thromboembolic events
    
  - Venous: DVT most common

  - Arterial: cerebral, renal, mesenteric, coronary, PE


- Pregnancy morbidity: recurrent, unexplained spontaneous abortions,
    fetal loss, preterm birth due to preeclampsia, placental
    insufficiency

- Other features: nonbacterial vegetations (Libman-Sachs
    endocarditis), thrombocytopenia, livedo reticularis

## Evaluation

- Revised Sapporo classification criteria: At least one of the
    clinical criteria and one of the laboratory criteria are met:

<!-- -->

- Vascular thrombosis (arterial, small vessel, or venous)

- Pregnancy morbidity

- Antiphospholipid lab testing: must be present on two or more
    occasions at least 12 weeks apart (NOT TESTED INPATIENT) Lupus
    anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibody (IgG or IgM, medium or high
    titer) anti-beta-2 glycoprotein-I antibody (IgG or IgM)

## Management

- Mainstay is anticoagulation for treatment and secondary prevention

- Acute thromboembolism: Heparin gtt with bridge to warfarin

- Secondary thrombosis prevention, anticoagulation with warfarin is
    preferred

<!-- -->

- Studies suggest that DOACs are less effective than warfarin

- Goal INR 2-3 regardless of whether arterial or venous
    thromboembolism present

<!-- -->

- ASA 81 mg + warfarin for pts w/arterial events and risks for ASCVD

# Catastrophic Anti-phospholipid Syndrome (CAPS)

## Background

- Rapid development of thromboses in multiple small blood vessels in
    various organs resulting in multi-organ failure. Occurs in a small
    subset of patients with APS

## Presentation

- Similar presentation to APS, but multiple organs are involved in a
    short period of time

- Renal (hypertension, proteinuria, hematuria, acute renal failure),
    Pulmonary (ARDS, PE), Central Nervous System (encephalopathy,
    stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis), Cardiac (coronary thrombosis),
    and Cutaneous (livedo reticularis, acrocyanosis, purpura,
    ecchymosis, splinter hemorrhages, and necrosis resulting in
    ulceration)

## Evaluation

- Exclude other causes of small vessel occlusion: HIT, DIC or TMA

- Definite dx= all 4 criteria met, probable dx=combination of criteria
    present

<!-- -->

  - Evidence of involvement of three or more organs, systems, and/or
      tissues

  - Development of manifestations simultaneously or in less than a week

  - Confirmation by histopathology of small vessel occlusion in at least
      one organ or tissue

  - Laboratory confirmation of the presence of antiphospholipid
      antibodies

## Management

- Anticoagulation: Heparin acutely. Warfarin once stable & no bleeding
    or recurrent thromboses

- Pulse steroids with methylprednisolone x 3 days followed by
    prednisone

- Severe cases may require PLEX/IVIG. Refractory CAPS may require
    rituximab or eculizumab
