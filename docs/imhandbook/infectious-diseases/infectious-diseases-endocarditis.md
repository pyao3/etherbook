## Background

-   Multiple etiologies of endocarditis:
    -   Typical Bacterial
        -   *S. aureus*, *Enterococcus spp* (*E. faecalis* most commonly),
            viridans group *streptococci*, *Strep gallolyticus* (formerly *S.
            bovis*)
        -   HACEK
            : *Haemophilus*, *Aggregatibacter*, *Cardiobacterium*, *Eikenella*,
            *Kingella*
    -   Other infectious
        -   Culture negative: often recent antimicrobial exposure, slow
            growing organism
        -   *Coxiella*, *Brucella*, *Bartonella*, *Chlamydia*, *Legionella*,
            *Mycoplasma*, *Tropheryma whipplei*, *Propionibacterium acnes*
        -   Fungal: *Candida* and *aspergillus* most common
    -   Non-infectious: a.k.a., marantic endocarditis, Libbman-Sacks
        Endocarditis
        -   Rare, most common in advanced malignancy, SLE, inflammatory
            conditions
        -   Higher risk for embolization compared to IE
        -   Risk factors: IV drug use, congenital heart disease, valve
            abnormalities, intracardiac devices, recent cardiac surgery

## Presentation 

-   Fever (90%), Murmur (85%), Other: splenomegaly, splinter
    hemorrhages, Janeway lesions, Osler Nodes, Roth Spots

-   Persistent bacteremia despite appropriate treatment, new onset
    cardiac dysfunction, new onset valve abnormalities, stroke, other
    thromboembolic events, metastatic infections/abscesses, splenic
    abscess, septic pulmonary emboli

## Duke Criteria:

-   Pathologic Criteria
    -   Microorganisms: culture or histology proven: vegetation,
        embolus, or intracardiac abscess
    -   Pathologic vegetations: vegetation of abscess with histology
        proven endocarditis
-   Clinical Criteria
    -   Major:
        -   2x positive blood cultures from a typical organism
        -   Evidence of endocardial involvement
-   Minor
    -   Predisposing heart condition/IVDU
    -   Fever
    -   Vascular phenomena (Glomerulonephritis)
    -   Immunologic phenomena (Osler Nodes, Roth Spots, +Rheumatoid
        factor, GN)
    -   Micro (Cultures that don’t fit the above, or serologic evidence
        of acute infection)
        -   -   -   -
-   Definite: 2 Major, 1 major and 3 minor, or 5 minor
-   Possible: 1 major and 1 minor, or 3 minor
-   Rejected: firm alternate diagnosis, resolution of evidence with \<4
    days of antibiotics, or absence of pathologic evidence with \<4days
    of antibiotics

## Evaluation

-   Physical exam: murmur, decreased peripheral perfusion, evidence of
    heart failure, petechiae, splinter hemorrhages, Janeway
    lesions/Osler nodes, organomegaly
-   Blood cultures: at least three sets from different sites over a span
    of several hours
-   Echo (TTE vs TEE)
    -   It can be reasonable to start with TEE if pretest probability is
        high enough, if patient has known valvular abnormalities, or TTE
        will be technically difficult
-
-   EKG: new heart block or prolonged PR raises concern for
    endocardial/perivalvular abscess. Endocarditis patients should be on
    telemetry, monitored closely by team
-   CXR: infiltrates suggestive of septic pulmonary emboli, pulmonary
    edema, cardiomegaly
-   Imaging of distant affected site if concerned for septic emboli
-   Other advanced imaging in select scenario: cardiac CTA, cardiac MRI,
    FDG-PET/CT

## Management

-   Empiric antibiotics:
    -   If bacteria isolated from blood, reference bacteremia section
        for abx choice
    -   If awaiting cultures
        -   Native valve: Vancomycin
        -   Prosthetic valve: Vancomycin and cefepime, consider
            gentamicin
-   Duration: determined by ID, often 4-6 weeks
-   Surgical consult, if valve dysfunction, perivalvular abscess, large
    (>20mm) vegetations

## Additional Information:

-   Complications: 
    -   Cardiac:
        -   Heart failure:  usually secondary to valve dysfunction. Most
            common when aortic valve involved, risk also depends on
            organism (worst is *Staph aureus* )
        -   Perivalvular abscess: suspect when there are conduction
            abnormalities on EKG; most likely when aortic valve
            involved, less likely with mitral valve.
        -   Pericarditis: can be suppurative or non-suppurative
        -   Intracardiac Fistula

    -   Septic emboli and metastatic abscesses
    -   Mycotic aneurysm: usually occurs at vessel branch points

-   Follow Up
    -   Repeat TTE at completion of treatment to establish new baseline
    -   Followed for valvular dysfunction with frequency determined by
        nature of the dysfunction. (MR caused by IE should be followed
        on a timeline like other MR)
    -   Regular dental care, Prior IE is an indication for SBE
        prophylaxis with dental work.

-   Episode of IE is an indication for PDA or VSD closure
