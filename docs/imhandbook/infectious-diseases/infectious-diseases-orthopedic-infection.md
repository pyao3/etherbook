# Joint Infections and Osteomyelitis â€“ VASP

## Evaluation

- Blood cultures prior to antibiotics

- MRI is the most sensitive and specific imaging modality for
    osteomyelitis.

- Ortho consult for joint fluid aspirate or bone bx; send for culture
    and send fluid for cell count/differential.

## Management

- Hold antibiotics until culture obtained, if patient is clinically
    stable

- Osteomyelitis is a 6-week treatment course, can consider early
    transition (at 2-3 weeks) to oral if good bioavailability and
    susceptibility.

- For prosthetic joint infection, procedure/retention of hardware
    determines duration

- First line empiric: Vancomycin + ciprofloxacin 750mg BID

- Antimicrobial therapy will ultimately be guided by culture data, ID
    consult recommended for joint infection treatment due to need for
    prolonged antibiotic therapy
