# Fungal Infections

# Histoplasmosis

## Background

- Endemic to Ohio and Mississippi river valley

- Pulmonary infiltrate with hilar or mediastinal LAD, pulmonary
    nodule/cavitary lesion, pulmonary syndrome with erythema nodosum

- DDx: TB, malignancy, sarcoidosis (if considering sarcoidosis, rule
    out histoplasmosis as sarcoidosis treatment can induce disseminated
    histoplasmosis)

## Evaluation

- Antigen (requires attending approval): For acute pulmonary
    histoplasmosis, 65% urine sensitivity, 69% serum sensitivity, and
    83% sensitivity when co-tested. Thus, both serum and urine Ag are
    usually sent together
    - Lower rates of positivity when disease is localized, versus diffuse
    throughout the lungs or disseminated.
    - There are relatively high rates of cross-reactivity, where
    histoplasma antigen will be positive with blastomycosis; therefore,
    do not order blasto Ag if ordering histo Ag in MOST cases

- Serology: Consider Histoplasma Ab if evaluating for pulmonary
    disease

- Culture: most useful in chronic infections, sensitivity is low in
    acute/localized and may take \>6 weeks to grow.

- Bronchoscopy: If clinical suspicion is high and work up negative,
    consider interventional pulmonology consult for consideration of
    bronchoscopy

## Management

- Outpatient/Mild disease:

    - Tx not required if symptoms \<4 weeks, initiate if symptomatic
    beyond 4 weeks
    - Itraconazole: 200mg TID x3 days loading, then BID (adjusted by
    levels which are drawn 2 weeks post-start) for 6-12 weeks minimum
    - Can use oral formulation or capsules (capsules require high acidity,
    give with food consumption or OJ or coke; do not use capsules if
    patient is on H2 blockers/PPI)
    - Voriconazole, Posaconazole: used if not tolerating itraconazole or
    as salvage therapy

- Inpatient/Moderate to Severe Disease:

    - Amphotericin: 1-2 weeks induction, followed by PO itraconazole for
    12 weeks (total)

    - Methylprednisolone: help to prevent ARDS with significant lung
    involvement

## Additional Information

- Complications: Pericarditis, arthritis/arthralgias with erythema
    nodosum, chronic cavitary lesions, fibrosing mediastinitis,
    broncholithiasis

- Disseminated Histoplasmosis:
    - Typically found in immunocompromised populations
    - Clinical presentations: FUO, weight loss, disseminated LAD,
    cutaneous manifestations, bone marrow suppression/pancytopenia,
    liver enzymes elevation, various solid organ involvement on imaging
    (liver, spleen, adrenals, nodes)
    - Management
        - Mild: itraconazole
        - Moderate to Severe: amphotericin induction followed by
        itraconazole
        - CNS involvement: amphotericin for 4-6 weeks as induction

# Blastomycosis

## Background

- Endemic to Mississippi/Ohio river valley, southern and midwestern
    US, great lakes

- Pulmonary syndrome: cough, fever, hemoptysis, chest pain, dyspnea
    - Can result in both an acute or chronic pneumonia, as well as ARDS

- Cutaneous: raised verrucous lesion, varying in color, with irregular
    borders

- MSK: osteolytic lesion, draining sinus, soft tissue swelling

- Multi-system: up to 20-40% of cases, most typically lung/skin
    involvement.

## Evaluation

- Culture: typically takes 1-4 weeks

- Ag: urine \>serum. \~90% sensitive, but only 80% specific because of
    cross-reactivity

- Serology: available, but not very useful because of high degree of
    cross-reactivity

## Management

- Mild: PO itraconazole for 6-12 months with loading, check level at 2
    weeks

- Moderate to Severe: induction with Amphotericin, followed by 6-12
    months of PO itraconazole

# Candida

## Background

- Oropharyngeal: white plaques in mouth, change in taste, erythema
    without plaques
    - Usually seen in infants, older adults, immunocompromised host (HIV
    or chemotherapy), inhaled steroid users

- Esophageal: odynophagia, especially retrosternal pain (AIDS defining
    illness)

- Vulvovaginitis: itching, burning, vaginal discharge, vulvar
    erythema, vulvar edema, dyspareunia, dysuria

- Balanitis: painful white plaques with burning and itching on the
    glans penis

- Mastitis: erythema, tenderness in breast feeding woman.

## Management

- Depends on specifics, but typically nystatin or fluconazole EXCEPT
    *C. glabrata* (proof of fluconazole susceptibility needed) and *C.
    krusei* (intrinsically resistant to fluconazole)

- Cx generally not indicated unless complicated pt with extensive tx
    history for Candida

## Additional Information

- Disseminated disease
    - Presentation: Primarily immunocompromised populations (hematologic
    malignancies, solid organ transplant recipients, receiving
    chemotherapy, TPN, steroid use, broad spectrum antibiotics) and ICU
    settings (especially, burn, trauma, and neonatal)
    - Diagnosis: *Candida* in a bacterial blood culture (NEVER
    contaminant)
    - Start micafungin 100mg IV and consult ID for candidemia or if
    concerned for disseminated disease
