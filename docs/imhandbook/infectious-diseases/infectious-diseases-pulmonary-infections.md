# Pulmonary Infections

VASP, Evan Schwartz

---

# Acute Bronchitis

## Background

- 1-3 wks productive cough, often preceded by URI, may have wheezing/rhonchi
- Distinct from chronic bronchitis (>3 mos of consecutive cough x 2 consecutive yrs)
- Distinct from PNA (parenchymal consolidation, fever >100.4F, hypoxia, tachypnea)
- DDx: COVID-19, post-nasal drip, GERD, undertreated/new asthma, ACE-i induced bradykinin cough, undertreated CHF, acute PE, or new lung cancer
- Clinical dx; CXR/labs not necessary unless PNA suspected

## Management

- Supportive: lozenges, cough suppressants (guaifenesin or dextromethorphan), smoking cessation. Consider albuterol inhaler for wheezing
- No indication for antibiotics

# Influenza

## Background

- Dx often clinical w/cough, sore throat, #sputum/nasal discharge, HA, fever, myalgias, and malaise; ± N/V/D. Exam with increased flushing, rarely with lower respiratory symptoms

## Evaluation

- During flu season: Obtain COVID/RPP or dedicated influenza PCR; testing is more accurate if obtained within 96 hour of symptom onset

- CXR if concerned for bacterial superinfection

## Management

- Antivirals most effective when given <48 hours from symptom onset; however, recommended to be given if symptomatic despite duration and to all hospitalized patients

- Oseltamivir 75mg BID x 5 days, peramivir 600mg IV x 1 (needs renal adjustment), or baloxavir (age ≥12) 40mg once (use 80 mg if >80kg)

- Amantadine and rimantadine are no longer used due to emerging resistance

# Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP)

## Background
- All PNA that does not otherwise meet criteria for Hospital Acquired
    Pneumonia (PNA that develops ≥48 hours after hospital admission),
    Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (PNA that develops ≥48-72 hours
    after endotracheal intubation), or aspiration PNA

- Healthcare-associated pneumonia is no longer a clinical entity per
    2016 IDSA guidelines

- MRSA Risk Factors: recent history, cavitary lesion, post-influenza
    bacterial PNA, pts with IDU, severe hypoxemia requiring intubation

- *Pseudomonas*: Double coverage is not indicated in general
    population; LVQ has 82% sensitivity so not recommended unless
    isolate proven susceptible

## Evaluation

- Sputum cultures prior to abx, consider BCx in select groups (severe
    pneumonia, ICU admission, cavitary disease, immunosuppression).

- Rule out flu if the right season, COVID-19, consider RVP if it will
    change management

- CURB-65 or PSI can aid in decision between outpatient vs inpatient
    therapy
    - CURB65: Confusion, Uremia (BUN \>=19 mg/dL), RR (\>30/min),
    BP(\<90/60 mmHg), Age ≥ 65 If ≥ 2, hospitalization is recommended.

<!-- -->

- Consider urine pneumococcal Ag, urine Legionella Ag in severe CAP
    and in certain pts (e.g., neutropenia, asplenia, obstructive lung
    disease, hyponatremia, diarrhea, or heavy alcohol use); these are
    performed at reference labs and will take several days to return.

- CRP, ESR, and pro-calcitonin have not been shown to reliably improve
    outcomes; however, pro-calcitonin \< 0.25 suggests against bacterial
    respiratory infection and antibiotic discontinuation is encouraged

- PA/ lateral CXR to evaluate for and localize infiltrate. If
    immunocompromised, consider CT chest w/o contrast (does not improve
    outcomes)
    - Lobar Consolidation - likely bacterial
    - Interstitial Infiltrate - likely atypical vs. viral vs.
    non-infectious
    - Cavitation - concerning for fungal vs. necrotizing vs. mycobacterial

## Management

- Antibiotic Duration: 5-7 days (at least 5 days and improvement with
    clinical stability)

immunocompromise

## Additional Information

- MRSA nasal swab has reported negative predictive value for MRSA
    pneumonia ranging 95% to \>99%; consider sending and if negative,
    discontinue MRSA agent

- CTX is generally adequate coverage for aspiration PNA without
    evidence of abscess, empyema, or cavitary lesion on imaging

- Aspiration pneumonia can be confused for aspiration pneumonitis
    which does not need to be treated with antibiotics. Rapid resolution
    of leukocytosis and stabilization of vitals suggest aspiration
    pneumonitis and consideration of stopping antibiotics.

- There is low sensitivity of S. pneumoniae to azithromycin (42%) and
    doxycycline (72%), so these should not be used as monotherapy

- Check for drug interactions with linezolid (e.g., SSRI, methadone,
    methamphetamine use)
    
# Hospital Acquired Pneumonia (HAP) and Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP)

## Background

- HAP: Pneumonia that develops \>48 hours after admission

- VAP: Pneumonia that develops \>48 hours after endotracheal
    intubation

## Evaluation

- Cultures of blood, sputum, endotracheal aspirate and/or bronchoscopy
    specimen

- Consider MRSA nares to help with de-escalation

- If there is concern for respiratory viruses: send influenza, COVID,
    RVP

## Management

- Initially cover for MRSA and *Pseudomonas*

- Antibiotic Duration: 7 days in uncomplicated cases, although
    specific pathogens (e.g., *Pseudomonas*) may require longer duration
    and ID guidance

- Consider ID consultation if the patient is not clinically improving
    on empiric therapy or if an MDR pathogen grows from culture

- If no MRSA isolated and pt is improving, consider stopping
    vancomycin ASAP

- There is concern for nephrotoxicity with combination Vancomycin and
    piperacillin-tazobactam, but data controversial
