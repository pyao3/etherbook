# HIV/AIDS and ART 

Kathryn Snyder and Quinton Taylor

## Background

- Why is ART important?
    - Clear morbidity and mortality benefits across all CD4 counts
    - Decreases subsequent infections (both common and opportunistic)
    - Decreased HIV related comorbid conditions, viral reservoirs, and
    transmission

- New HIV Diagnosis
    - ID consult if patient is not on Rogers ID service (important for
    initiation, follow up \[CCC\], social work assistance)
    - ART is indicated for all HIV+ patients, regardless of CD4; however,
    starting ART requires appropriate outpatient follow up
    - Lab evaluation:
        - HIV viral load, genotype, and resistance testing

        - T cell subsets (CD4 Count), CBC with differential, CMP, UA

        - HLA\*B5701 testing before using abacavir containing regimen

        - QuantiFERON Gold

        - Pregnancy testing

        - Viral hepatitis serologies

        - Toxoplasma serologies

        - Other STI screening (Syphilis, Gonorrhea/Chlamydia)

- Timing of ART initiation
    - Factors affecting timing of initiation
        - Drug toxicity and interactions, risks for resistance, adherence barriers
        - Treatment of opportunistic infections may delay initiation of ART given associated risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)
            - Delay ART for several weeks after initiation of therapy for cryptococcal meningitis, tuberculosis, and CMV retinitis

- ART plan for overnight admits: okay to continue home ART, special
    consideration for:
    - Patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction may need dose adjustment
    - Interactions with other newly initiated medications
    - If there is concern for non-adherence, can hold morning dose
    - Combination pills may need to be ordered as separate components

- Common key regimens for initiation
    - Most regimens consist of an NRTI backbone (2 agents) plus a 3<sup>rd</sup> agent
    - Some dual therapy regimens (such as Dovato@) are non-inferior to
    standard 3-drug therapy
    - Many patients are started on combination pill regimens, including
    Integrase Inhibitor based regimens: Biktarvy®, Dovato®, Triumeq®,
    Genvoya®, dolutegravir + Descovy®
