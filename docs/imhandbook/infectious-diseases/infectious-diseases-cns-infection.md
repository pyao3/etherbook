# Central Nervous System Infection – VASP

# Bacterial Meningitis

## Evaluation

- Blood cultures prior to antibiotics if possible

- Head CT pre-LP, only if: Immunocompromised, hx of CNS diseases
    (shunts, trauma, tumors), papilledema on exam or FND, AMS, or new
    onset seizure.

- If there is a delay in obtaining head CT or LP, DO NOT delay
    antibiotics.

- Lumbar puncture (See Procedures Section):

    - Obtain: Opening pressure, cell count + differential, glucose,
    protein, bacterial culture

    - Send an extra tube or two of CSF to the lab, if possible, to be
    frozen in case extra testing is needed (Order ‘Miscellaneous test’
    and for test name put “Please freeze CSF in virology;” reference
    lab: VUMC, specimen type: CSF)

    - Additional studies to consider in select pts: HSV 1, 2 PCR (NOT
    antibodies), VZV PCR, VDRL, Crypto Ag, fungal and/or AFB cultures,
    MTB PCR, West Nile Virus Ab, Enterovirus PCR, Histoplasma Ag, or
    Biofire Meningitis/Encephalitis Panel. These should not be performed
    routinely on all patients and consult ID where management questions
    exist.

    - If Biofire Meningitis/Encephalitis Panel is performed, double check
    what is included to avoid sending duplicate individual tests (ie
    HSV, VZV, enterovirus, etc.) A negative cryptococcus on Biofire does
    not exclude disease (CSF Crypto Ag is more sensitive)

## Management

- ANTIBIOTICS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE:

    - Ceftriaxone 2g IV q12h + Vancomycin, adjusted for renal function

    - Piperacillin-tazobactam cannot be used due to poor CNS penetration

    - IV ampicillin 2g q4h for optional coverage of Listeria for
    immunocompromised patients, pregnant women, or age \>50 (adjust
    based on renal function)

    - IV acyclovir 10 mg/kg (based on adjusted body weight) q8h, if
    suspected HSV or VZV meningitis, make sure to run with adequate
    pre-hydration with NS

    - Consider empiric PO/IV doxycycline 100mg BID if tick-borne illness
    is suspected

- Steroids: Based on IDSA guidelines, steroids (dexamethasone 0.15
    mg/kg q6h) should be given about 10-20 minutes before the first dose
    of antibiotics, or at the same time, in patients with suspected
    bacterial meningitis. IF pneumococcus is isolated, continue IV
    steroids for 2-4 days; otherwise, can discontinue

- ID consultation: Duration should be guided by ID and varies based on
    organism recovered

# Encephalitis

## Background

- The presence or absence of normal brain function/cognition is the
    important distinguishing clinical feature between encephalitis and
    meningitis

## Evaluation

- MRI more sensitive that CT, although imaging may or may not
    demonstrate abnormal radiographic findings in patients with
    encephalitis

- LP – similar studies as for meningitis (see above) + BioFire MEP for
    ALL pts

## Management

- Acyclovir 10mg/kg IV q8hr, consideration of antibacterial therapy if
    unable to conclusively exclude a bacterial meningitis, consideration
    of doxycycline if tick-borne infection is on the differential, and
    further treatment as guided by ID

- ID consult is strongly encouraged for all patients with suspected
    encephalitis

# Brain Abscess

## Evaluation/Management

- Consult: Neurosurgery and ID

- Blood Cultures, HIV testing in any patient with a brain lesion

- Empiric antibiotics:

    - IV Vancomycin (target trough 15 - 20 mcg/mL) + ceftriaxone 2g IV
    q12h + metronidazole 500mg IV/PO q6h

    - If concern for extension from otitis externa, use an antipseudomonal
    cephalosporin (cefepime 2g IV Q8h) instead of ceftriaxone

    - Brain abscesses generally polymicrobial, thus broad-spectrum
    antibiotics indicated

- Aminoglycosides, macrolides, tetracyclines (e.g. doxycycline),
    clindamycin, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase combinations (e.g., Zosyn)
    and 1st-generation cephalosporins (e.g., cefazolin) should NOT be
    used as they do not cross BBB at high concentration.

- Antibiotic Duration: Based on surgical drainage and Infectious
    Diseases guidance

# Epidural Abscess

## Management

- If spinal lesion, consult ‘Spine surgery’ and it will be directed to
    Ortho-Spine or Neurosurgery, depending on who is on call.

- Antibiotics should be started as soon as the diagnosis of epidural
    abscess is suspected, immediately following the collection of two
    sets of blood cultures

    - Vancomycin 15-20mg/kg IV q8-12h (adjusted for renal function) +
    ceftriaxone 2g IV q24h (or q12hr if there is secondary meningitis)

    - Use cefepime 2g IV q8h instead of ceftriaxone if concern for
    *Pseudomonas*

- ID consult is strongly encouraged and they will guide duration
