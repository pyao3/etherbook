# Background

- COVID-19 is the novel coronavirus responsible for the ongoing
    pandemic that started in late 2019. The virus has ongoing mutations
    resulting in new dominant strains.

## Evaluation

- Please see the most updated VUMC and VA guidance due to frequently
    evolving recommendations.

- Please refer to the hospitalâ€™s current maximum oxygen requirement
    allowed on the floor to ensure patient is appropriately triaged.

- Basic admission workup for symptomatic, confirmed COVID-19

    - Labs: CBC with diff, CMP, d-dimer, ferritin, CRP, ESR, PT/INR, PTT,
    procalcitonin, RPP

    - Imaging: portable CXR

    - Nursing: Strict I/O

    - Enhanced precautions (contact, airborne, eye protection)

## Management

- Fluid balance goal slightly net negative to even

- Anticoagulation/DVT prophylaxis:

    - Please see latest VUMC or VA guidance based on clinical status
    (supplemental O2 requirements, ICU vs floor, etc.)

- Pharmacologic therapies

    - Note: Therapies, indications, and contraindications are frequently
    changing, please see latest VUMC/VA guidelines for specific
    indications for these medications or others

- Remdesivir

    - Loading dose 200mg IV x1 then 100mg daily x 4 days

    - For use in patients hospitalized for COVID within 7 days of
        symptom onset

    - Contraindications: known hypersensitivity, ALT \>/= 10x ULN,
        high-flow NC, PPV, intubated, or on ECMO

    - Monitoring: baseline CBC, INR, q48h CMP

- Dexamethasone

    - 6mg PO/IV x 10 days; consideration of longer taper if no
        clinical improvement or persistently elevated CRP

    - Contraindications: no hard contraindications, use clinical
        judgement if concomitant serious bacterial/fungal infection

- Antibiotics:

    - The incidence of superimposed bacterial infection in the setting
        of COVID-19 is low

    - The majority of patients do not need additional coverage for
        bacterial pneumonia

    - You can use procalcitonin to guide decision

- Other pharmacologic therapies include baricitinib (JAK inhibitor),
    tocilizumab (IL-6 inhibitor) and monoclonal antibodies

    - High PE/DVT risk

    - Superimposed bacterial PNA

    - AKI
