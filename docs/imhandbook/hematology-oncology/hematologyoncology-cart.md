# CAR T-cell Therapy

Chelsie Sievers

---

## Background

- Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) are a type of autologous
    T-cell therapy collected from the patient and genetically modified
    to contain an extracellular tumor-specific antigen target linked to
    the internal component of the T-cell receptor.
- Goal: patient's own T-cells can specifically target the tumor cell
    population.
- FDA approved therapies: Kymriah (CD19), Abecema (BCMA), Breyanzi
    (CD19), Tecartus (CD19), Yescarta (CD19)

## Complications

- Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS)
    - Pathophysiology: Supraphysiologic immune cell response with
        release of inflammatory cytokines.
        - Grade 1: fever ≥100.4, no hypotension, no hypoxia
        - Grade 2: fever ≥100.4, hypotension not requiring
            vasopressors and/or hypoxia requiring < 6L
        - Grade 3: fever ≥100.4, hypotension requiring a vasopressor,
            hypoxia requiring >6L or non-rebreather
        - Grade 4: fever ≥100.4, hypotension requiring multiple
            vasopressors, hypoxia requiring positive pressure
    - Work-up: blood and urine cultures (IV abx if needed)
    - Treatment: acetaminophen for fever, ICU transfer (grade 1 okay
        for floor), Tocilizumab 8 mg/kg IV (max 800mg; up to 3 doses in
        24 hours, 8 hours apart), Dexamethasone 10 mg IV q 6 hours
        (grade 3-4).
- ICANS: Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome
- Pathophysiology: high systemic inflammation leaky blood brain
    barrier encephalopathy +/- cerebral edema.
    - Based on ICE score: Orientation: orientation to year, month,
        city, hospital: 4 points; Naming: ability to name 3 objects (eg,
        point to clock, pen, button): 3 points; Following commands:
        ability to follow simple commands (eg, “Show me 2 fingers” or
        “Close your eyes and stick out your tongue”): 1 point; Writing:
        ability to write a standard sentence (eg, “Our national bird is
        the bald eagle”): 1 point; Attention: ability to count backwards
        from 100 by 10: 1 point.
    - Grade 1: ICE score: 7-9
    - Grade 2: ICE score: 3-6
    - Grade 3: ICE score 0-2
    - Grade 4: ICE score 0
- Work-up: neuro consult, fundoscopic exam for papilledema, consider
    MRI brain w/&w/o contrast, consider EEG, consider non-con CT head if
    headache/lethargy.
- Treatment: q4hr neuro checks (q1hr if grade >2 → ICU transfer),
    Keep Na 135-145 with hypertonic saline if necessary (Na 145-150 if
    grade 4), consider thiamine supplementation 500mg q8hrs,
    Dexamethasone 10 mg q 6 hours (if seizure give 20mg x 1, then 10mg
    q6hrs) (grade 2-3), Methylprednisolone 1000 mg IV q 24 x 3 days
    (grade 4).
