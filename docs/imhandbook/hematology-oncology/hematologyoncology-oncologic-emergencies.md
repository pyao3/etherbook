## Leukostasis

### Presentation

- Primarily occurs with acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic
    leukemia. This is not common with CLL or CML with high leukocyte
    counts in the absence of a significant increased portion of
    peripheral blasts
- Respiratory: dyspnea, hypoxia (note CXR may be normal)
- PaO2 by ABG often falsely low from WBC consuming O2 in vitro. Trust
    SpO2.
- CNS: headache, AMS, vision changes, dizziness, tinnitus, gait
    instability, neuro deficit

### Evaluation

- CBC with diff and peripheral blood smear
- Imaging: CT head to evaluate neuro deficit and to check for ICH
- Chest X-Ray vs CT chest to evaluate dyspnea and air space
    abnormalities

### Management

- Call hematology
- Emergent cytoreduction
- Leukapheresis: page nephrology and place dialysis catheter
- Hydroxyurea and chemotherapy per hematology fellow
- Transfer/admit to ICU

## Tumor Lysis Syndrome

### Background

- Lysis of malignant cells either spontaneously or in response to
    chemotherapy causing release of K, Phos, nucleic acids, and
    cytokines
- Consequences:
    - Hyperkalemia: most urgent and immediately life threatening
    - Hyperphosphatemia: binds Ca and leads to CaPhos crystal deposition
        AKI, HypoCa
    - Hyperuricemia (from breakdown of DNA) precipitation in renal tubules
        AKI
    - Hypotension, AKI from cytokine release
- Laboratory TLS
- Uric acid ≥ 8, Ca2+ ≤ 7, K+, or PO43- ≥ 4.5
- *or* > 25% change from baseline in these values

### Evaluation

- Risk Stratification:
    - Highest risk after starting chemotherapy, but can occur
        spontaneously
    - Tumor characteristics which confer a higher risk of developing TLS:
        - High (>5% risk): ALL (WBC> 100K or LDH 2x ULN), AML (WBC> 100K),
            Burkitt’s (III/IV or LDH≥2xULN, DLBCL with bulky disease,
            intermediate risk + AKI/CKD
        - Intermediate: ALL (WBC<100K, LDH <2x ULN), AML (WBC 25-100K),
            Burkitt’s LDH<2x ULN), DLBCL (non-bulky, LDH>ULN), CLL (if tx with
            fludarabine, rituximab, lenalidomide, or venetoclax +LN 5-10 cm or
            ALC≥25K), plasma cell leukemia, rare chemo-sensitive solid tumors
            (small cell)
        - Low: all others

### Management

- Prevention:
    - High risk: q6-8h TLS labs, IVF (±loop diuretic if volume overload),
        allopurinol, ± rasburicase
    - Intermediate – q8h TLS labs, IVF, allopurinol
    - Low – daily TLS labs, IVF
        - Significant hydration: goal to maintain UOP 80-100 mL/hr
        - Allopurinol: 300 mg PO BID for CrCl > 20 mL/min, UpToDate renal
            dosing if lower
        - Rasburicase ($$$): contraindicated in G6PD (send G6PD if not
            urgent and AA, Asian or Jewish descent)
            - Given if uric acid > 8 mg/dL: get fellow approval before
                ordering
- Treatment: (Can use as night/cross cover handoff)
    - K+ > 5.5: STAT EKG. Kayexalate 30g orally or 60g per rectum (unless
        contraindicated) x1
        - Give 10 U insulin/1 amp D50
        - If EKG changes, then calcium gluconate and D5W at 100 mL/hr with
            repeat BG in 1 hr
    - Uric acid > 8 with 25% change from baseline: page hematology fellow
        to discuss rasburicase
    - PO4 > 4.5 with 25% change from baseline: start/↑ phos binder
        (sevelamer)
    - Dialysis may be necessary in patients with poor renal function.
    - IV calcium: do not administer unless symptomatic AND
        hyperphosphatemia is corrected
        - With high phos, IV calcium can lead to calcium deposition and
            renal failure
    - Hemodialysis: pt with anuria, refractory hyperkalemia, and
        symptomatic hypocalcemia

## Superior Vena Cava (SVC) Syndrome

### Background

- Commonly Associated Malignancies: Lung Cancer, Non-Hodgkin or
    Hodgkin Lymphoma, Mediastinal Germ Cell Tumors, Thymic Malignancies
- Partial or complete obstruction of the SVC impedes blood return from
    the upper extremities, head, neck, and brain resulting in upstream
    congestion
- Can be 2/2 a mass in the mediastinum or thrombosis (foreign body
    i.e. catheter)

### Presentation

- Facial or neck swelling without generalized edema
- Sense of head fullness, exacerbated by leaning forward or lying down
- Pulmonary symptoms including dyspnea, stridor, hoarseness, cough -
    due to edema narrowing the nasal passages and larynx or mechanical
    airway obstruction
- Physical Exam: facial and neck edema particularly of the eye lids in
    the morning, distended neck and chest veins; can also sometimes see
    upper extremity swelling, papilledema, plethora. Look for associated
    lymph node enlargement anywhere particularly including
    supraclavicular, cervical, and axillary region

### Evaluation

- CXR: may show mass, perihilar or mediastinal disease
- Contrasted CT scan ± CT Venography: Phased to get a view of clot
    contribution to obstruction guides decision regarding
    anticoagulation or stenting
- Radiology attending can coordinate with techs (requires verbal
    direct request)
- MRI/MRV may provide additional information (often not possible due
    to pt too sick)

### Management

- Assess airway and prepare for intubation if needed
- Keep head of bed elevated
- Thrombosis:
    - Removal of lines/catheters associated with thrombus
    - Consideration of anticoagulation
- Tumor compression: the type of tumor guides treatment (tissue biopsy
    is key)
- Stat/urgent consultations:
    - Interventional radiology for possible stenting/dilatation
    - Radiation oncology- for radiation therapy
    - Interventional pulmonology – for help with tissue dx
    - Medical oncology – for help with diagnosis and chemotherapy

## Spinal Cord Compression

### Background

- Malignancies where cord compression is most common:
    - Multiple Myeloma, Lymphoma (both Hodgkin and NHL), Lung, Breast,
        Prostate Cancer
- Tumor mass & compressed and often displaced bone impinges thecal sac
    or nerve roots spinal cord or any spinal nerves including the cauda
    equina

### Presentation

- Back pain, motor, or sensory deficits
- Cauda Equina syndrome bowel or bladder incontinence, ataxia

### Evaluation

- Neurologic exam with sensation testing seeking level below an
    identified dermatome
- Lab testing: If no known malignancy check CBC, CMP, SPEP, and (in
    males) PSA
- Bladder US if suspicion or retention with or without overflow
    incontinence

### Management

- If suspected, order MRI without and with contrast; if patient unable
    to have MRI, CT myelography may be considered
- Immediate high dose steroids (dosing is controversial with
    recommendations ranging from 4 to 100 mg of dexamethasone q6h -
    choice of dexamethasone is to minimize mineralocorticoid effects.
    Most common dosing is 10mg IV x1 followed by 4mg IV q6h)
- Consider stat/urgent consultation with:
    - Neurosurgery for diagnostic/therapeutic intervention
    - Radiation oncology- for radiation therapy
    - Medical oncology – for help with diagnosis and chemotherapy
- Ensure regular neuro-vascular checks and close monitoring.

## Brain Metastases

### Background

- Common malignancies: Lung (NSCLC), breast, kidney, colorectal
    carcinomas & melanomas
- Significantly more common than primary brain tumors
- 80% of brain metastasis occur in the cerebrum at grey/white matter
    junction

### Presentation

- Highly variable: consider brain mets in any cancer pt w/ neurologic
    or behavioral changes
- Headache: worse in the mornings, with bending over or with valsalva
- Nausea/vomiting
- Cognitive dysfunction: changes in memory, mood or personality
- Focal neurologic deficits
- Signs of elevated ICP: papilledema, vision changes, drowsiness,
    presyncope
- Seizures
- Stroke (particularly in melanoma, choriocarcinoma, thyroid & renal
    carcinomas)

### Evaluation

- STAT CT if concerned for stroke or elevated ICP
- MRI with contrast: most sensitive, can differentiate between
    metastases vs. other lesions
    - Suggestive features: multiple lesions, location, circumscribed
        margins, vasogenic edema
- If pt has no known primary tumor: consider CT C/A/P +/- PET to
    identify primary
- Biopsy with histopathology & IHC: if diagnosis in doubt or if only a
    single lesion is present

### Management

- If severe HA, N/V, focal deficits: systemic glucocorticoids
- Dexamethasone 10mg IV x1 followed by 4mg IV q6h (can be PO if
    tolerated)
- Stat/urgent consults:
    - Neurosurgery – for diagnostic/therapeutic intervention
    - Radiation oncology – for radiation therapy
    - Medical oncology – for help with diagnosis and chemotherapy
- Ensure regular neuro-vascular checks and close monitoring
- Do not perform LP without input from neurology
