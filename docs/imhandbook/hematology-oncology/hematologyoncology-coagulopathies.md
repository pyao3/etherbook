# Coagulopathies

## Overview

- Step one: determine if platelet vs coagulation disorder
- Platelet Disorders: Skin/mucous membrane bleeding; Petechiae; Often
    mild bleeding following surgery and tends to immediately follow
    surgery
- Coagulation defect: Bleeding deep in soft tissues (muscles/joints);
    hemarthroses, hematomas; tendency to have delayed bleeding after
    surgery that can be severe
- Coagulopathies can be divided into Hereditary vs Acquired causes

## Hereditary

### Hemophilia A (Factor VIII Deficiency) and Hemophilia B (Factor IX Deficiency)

- Inherited in X-linked Recessive pattern
- Diagnosis: Isolated prolonged PTT with normalization upon mixing
    study
- Management: purified/recombinant Factor VIII or IX. Desmopressin for
    mild disease
- Consult benign hematology every time these patients are admitted

### von Willebrand Disease (vWD)

- Can be hereditary (common) or acquired
- Abnormal quantity or function of von Willebrand Factor (vWF) needed
    for platelet function
- Type 1 (most common): Quantitative defect. Low quantity, normal
    function of vWF
- Type 2: Qualitative defect. Normal quantity, abnormal function of
    vWF.
- Type 3 (rare): Complete absence of vWF, phenotypically similar to
    hemophilia A
- Order in Epic: vW Profile = vWF Ag, Factor VIII Activity, Ristocetin
    Cofactor Activity
- Management: Desmopressin (DDAVP) can be useful as prophylaxis or
    treatment; most patients are treated with factor concentrate
    replacements

## Acquired

### Coagulation Factor Inhibitors

- Associated with autoimmune disease (paraneoplastic vs. autoantibody)
- Seen in hemophilia due to frequent treatments with recombinant
    factors (alloantibody)
- Diagnosis: Elevated PTT that does not normalize with mixing study
- Management: Immunosuppression with steroids; cyclophosphamide +/-
    rituximab
- Consult Hematology always (rare disorder with major bleeding
    complications)

### Vitamin K Deficiency

- Caused by malnutrition, liver disease, or iatrogenic with warfarin
- Diagnosis: elevated PT, if severe may have prolonged PTT as well
- Management: Replace vitamin K
