# Bone Marrow Transplant

## Background

- Donor selection
    - Autologous: self, no matching required (no GVHD risk, but also no
        graft-vs-tumor effect)
    - Allogeneic: non-self, matching based on HLA (more matched = less
        GVHD risk)
        - Matched-related donor (MRD): fully matched sibling
        - Matched-unrelated donor (MUD): From NMDP database
        - Haploidentical: Half matched sibling or parent
- Source of stem cells:
    - Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) vs bone marrow-derived cells vs
    umbilical cord
- Conditioning regimens:
    - Myeloablative vs Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC)
- GVHD prophylaxis (for allo-SCT):
- Regimen varies, can include tacrolimus, MMF, MTX, or thymo and
    alemtuzumab during conditioning

## Complications/Adverse Effects

Infectious

- Neutropenic fever, neutropenic enterocolitis (typhlitis)
- Bacterial infections
- Viral infections
    - CMV: check weekly PCR levels post-allo-SCT
        - All CMV+ recipients are treated with letermovir
            prophylactically regardless of donor status
    - EBV: check weekly PCR levels post allo-SCT. If EBV VL \>1000 on
        two occasions, can treat with pre-emptive rituximab to reduce
        the risk of PTLD
- Invasive fungal infections (e.g. aspergillus, candida)

Non-infectious

- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, mucositis, cytopenias
- Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD)/sinusoidal obstructive syndrome
    (SOS)
    - Pathophysiology: sinusoidal endothelial cell damage from
        conditioning chemo post-sinusoidal portal HTN cytokine release
        multiorgan failure and death
    - Diagnosis: T Bili >2, hepatomegaly/RUQ pain, weight gain >2-5%
    - Evaluation: RUQ US with doppler
    - Treatment: Per heme attending; generally supportive, consider
        defibrotide
- Graft failure:
    - Primary (persistent neutropenia without engraftment)
    - Secondary (delayed pancytopenia 2/2 immune phenomena or
        infection after engraftment)
- Engraftment syndrome:
    - Pathophysiology: PMN recovery cytokine storm vascular leak
    - Symptoms: fever, tachycardia, hypotension, SOB, pulmonary edema,
        rash, weight gain, bone pain, confusion
    - Diagnosis: Clinical
    - Treatment: high-dose IV steroids
- Acute GVHD:
    - Only in allogenic; Increased risk with more HLA mismatch
    - Pathophysiology: donor T cells attack recipient (Th1-mediated)
    - Symptoms: skin rash, cholestatic liver injury, diarrhea
    - Treatment: IV steroids (methylprednisolone 1-2mg/kg x 5d)
        - If refractory: mycophenolate, etanercept, ruxolitinib,
            antithymocyte globulin
- Chronic GVHD (typically after T+100)
    - Can involve all organs but typically see a scleroderma-like
        picture (xerophthalmia, xerostomia dysphagia, arthritis, skin
        changes, malar rash, obliterative bronchiolitis, cholestatic
        liver injury, cytopenias)
    - Treatment: steroids (also photophoresis for skin), consider
        trials of ruxolitinib, ibrutinib, rituximab if refractory
- PTLD (post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders)
    - Pathophysiology: B-cell proliferative disease typically 2/2
        latent EBV
    - Symptoms: fever, weight loss, fatigue, lymphadenopathy,
        extra-nodal masses, â†‘ EBV PCR
