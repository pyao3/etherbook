# Venous Thromboembolism

## Background

- Includes both deep vein thrombosis (DVTs) and pulmonary embolism
    (PE). See “Pulmonary Embolism” section in cardiology for more
    information on PEs
- Risk Factors for Provoked DVT/PE
    - Major risk factors: major surgery >30 minutes, hospitalization > 3
        days, C-section
    - Minor Risk Factors: Surgery <30 minutes, Hospitalization <3 days,
        pregnancy, estrogen therapy, reduced mobility >3 days
    - Non-transient risk factors: Malignancy (active), IBD, liver disease,
        hereditary thrombophilia

## Evaluation

- Asymmetric calf swelling of >2cm sensitivity and specificity for
    DVT of 60-70%
- Wells’ Criteria for DVT can help guide diagnostic testing
- If a patient has a low pre-test probability, a negative D-dimer can
    rule out DVT
- In a high pre-test probability patient a negative D-dimer is less
    helpful
- Whole-leg ultrasounds with doppler

## Management

- Prophylaxis: Padua score
- Score > 4 high risk, recommend pharmacologic prophylaxis
    - Subcutaneous Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) or Subcutaneous
        Heparin
- Score <4 is low risk; recommend ambulation and SCDs
- Treatment (see anticoagulation section)
    - Subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)
    - Oral factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban)
    - Intravenous unfractionated heparin
    - Warfarin (with bridge therapy)
- Duration of treatment
    - Provoked: 3 months or until provoking factor (trauma, surgery,
        malignancy) is removed
    - Unprovoked: Typically requires life-long anticoagulation along with
        assistance from hematology
- Anticoagulation in malignancy:
    - LMWH or DOAC (most evidence for apixaban and rivaroxaban) while
        malignancy still active
    - Avoid rivaroxaban and edoxaban in GI malignancies (increased rates
        of bleeding)

## Additional Information

- Should we get a follow up ultrasound?
    - A follow up ultrasound at the CONCLUSION of anticoagulation can help
    establish a post-treatment baseline and provide a baseline study for
    future comparison that can be critical for the diagnosis of
    recurrent/new DVT (which is very difficult to determine
    radiographically without a comparison imaging study)
- What about IVC filters?
    - Select circumstances for these: In patients with acute DVT or PE and
    in whom anti-coagulation is absolutely contraindicated
    (thrombocytopenia, recent intra-cranial bleed, recent GI bleed)
    placement of a retrievable IVC filter should be discussed with
    Hematology and IR
