# Acute Leukemia

## Background

- Hematological malignancy caused by unchecked proliferation of WBC
    precursors in the bone marrow
- Pt’s with suspected acute leukemia require hospitalization for
    urgent diagnosis & treatment
- Types:
    - AML = Acute Myeloid Leukemia
        - APL = Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia defined by translocation
            (15;17) PML-RARA
    - ALL = Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia
- Risk Factors:
    - radiation, chemical exposures (e.g benzene), chemotherapy (esp
        alkylating agents)
    - HIV, immunosuppression, smoking
    - myeloproliferative disorders, aplastic anemia

## Presentation

- Leukocytosis, leukemia cutis, gingival hypertrophy, leukostasis
- Functional Leukopenia, often neutropenia: recurrent infections
- Anemia: fatigue, pallor, dyspnea
- Thrombocytopenia: gingival bleeding, epistaxis, petechiae,
    ecchymoses, menorrhagia
- Extramedullary hematopoiesis: splenomegaly, hepatomegaly,
    lymphadenopathy

## Evaluation

- Diagnosis of acute leukemia requires one of the following:
    - 20% blasts in peripheral blood
    - > 20% blasts in bone marrow biopsy
    - Any pathognomonic cytogenetic abnormality of t(8;21), inv(16),
        t(15;17)
- Check for the presence of these time-sensitive conditions.
    - DIC – check fibrinogen, PT, PTT, platelets
    - TLS – check uric acid, phosphate, K+
    - Neutropenic fever – check temp, neutrophil count
    - Leukostasis (see below)
    - Presumptive APL – promyelocytes on diff, DIC or Auer rods on smear
- Confirm if peripheral flow cytometry ordered/in process
- Use hematology admission order set
- Set RBC and Plt transfusion thresholds
- Order nurse-driven electrolyte repletion
- ECG and TTE to establish pre-chemotherapy cardiac function
- Daily labs: CBC, TLS, DIC
- TLS prophylaxis

## Management

- Consult hematology
- Discuss chemo plan and order double lumen PICC for reliable access
- If findings suggest APL start ATRA
- Subspecialized lab tests: bone marrow biopsy, cytogenetics, FISH
- Monitor for Common Complications/Emergencies: (see individual
    sections)
    - TLS, DIC, Febrile Neutropenia, Leukostasis

## Additional Information

- Obtain blood product consent on admission
- APL Specific findings: promyelocytes on differential or Auer rods on
    smear
- Differentiation syndrome: promyelocytes differentiate
    - Symptoms and signs: fever, SOB, Hypotn, peripheral edema, pleural
        effusion, AKI
    - Diagnosis: No defined criteria. If suspicious, discuss with
        hematology fellow
    - Management: steroids. If critically ill, hold ATRA and ATO and
        consider hydroxyurea

## Leukemia Treatment Overview

- General strategy is to use “induction” chemo to try to induce
    clinicopathologic (as opposed to molecular) “remission”
- Defined as absence of symptoms, normal CBC, and <5% blasts in bone
    marrow (on day 28)
- Then waiting in hospital until neutrophil count >500 (typically ~3 weeks)
- From there, bone marrow transplant (for high-risk disease) or
    “consolidation” chemo for normal-risk or low-risk disease

## AML Treatment

- Induction
    - Typical is “7+3” i.e. idrarubicin on days 1-3 and cytarabine on days
        1-7
    - If therapy-related AML, MDS-related AML, or AML with cytogenetics
        similar to MDS, use “Vyxeos” which is liposomal daunorubicin and
        cytarabine on days 1, 3, and 5
    - If low-risk dz (t(8;21) or inv(16)), use cytarabine on days 1-7, and
        3 days of low-dose daunorubicin + gemtuzumab-ozogamicin
    - There are other induction regimens that can be used depending on
        specific cytogenetics and patient frailty, which is beyond the scope
        of the handbook
- Consolidation
    - Typically “HiDAC”(high-dose Ara-C i.e. cytarabine)
        - Generally too toxic for pts with age > 60, so a dose reduction
            is used
    - In the case of relapse, typical treatment is a different high-dose
        chemo and BMT if possible

## ALL Treatment

- Typical induction is “HyperCVAD” (hyper-fractionated
    cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin (“A” due to trade name
    Adriamycin), and dexamethasone
- If t(9;22) (known as Philadelphia chromosome), use tyrosine kinase
    inhibitor (TKI)
- If CD20+, use rituximab
