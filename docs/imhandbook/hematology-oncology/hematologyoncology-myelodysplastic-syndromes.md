# Myelodysplastic Syndromes

## Background

- MDS is a malignant clonal myeloid disorder resulting in ineffective
    (dysplastic) hematopoiesis leading to peripheral cytopenia’s and a
    risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
- Usually idiopathic, a disease of the elderly (median onset at age
    70)
- The WHO has several classification schemes for MDS
    - Most important for classification is the percent of blasts in the
        bone marrow
    - Note >20% blasts in marrow = AML. Thus MDS & AML are on a continuum

## Presentation

- 50% asymptomatic; Symptoms can include nonspecific but gradual
    fatigue, weakness
- Dysplastic cells do not work properly infections and bleeding are
    more likely
- Macrocytic anemia is most common finding; followed by bicytopenia or
    pancytopenia
- Isolated neutropenia or thrombocytopenia are unusual but possible
- Ask about secondary causes:
    - Exposure to chemicals (benzene, crude oil/gasoline industry,
        cigarette smoke), chemotherapy, radiation
    - Medications, alcohol use, chronic infections (HIV)

## Evaluation

- Goal is to rule out reversible causes of dysplasia and cytopenias
- CBC w/differential, Peripheral Smear, B12, Folate, HIV
- May consider Copper & Zinc (send out labs, are expensive and rare
    but check when MDS is being considered)
- Dysplastic changes on peripheral smear: hypogranulated/hyposegmented
    neutrophils, hypogranulated platelets and macrocytosis of RBCs
- Circulating myeloblasts can be seen
- Final diagnosis made by Bone marrow Biopsy

## Management

- Molecular characteristics define the “risk” of the disease and
    dictates treatments
- Prognostic scoring tools: revised international prognostic staging
    system (R-IPSS)
- Management general paradigm:
    - Asymptomatic: with low-risk disease = monitoring
    - Low-risk disease + symptoms due to anemia only: transfusions,
        erythrocyte stimulating agents, and treatment with Luspatercept
    - MDS with isolated del(5q): treated with lenalidomide
    - High-risk patients: treated with hypomethylating agents
    - Only curative intervention = hematopoietic stem cell transplant
        (HSCT)
