## VUMC Oncology Rotation Tips

The inpatient oncology rotation involves complex decisions often
resulting from advancing diseases. The question “What do you want?” is
too simple. Rather, it should be “Given your current circumstance, and
given our choices, which path would you prefer to take?” Patients want
advice from their outpatient doctors who have been caring for them for
years. Therefore, treatment and goals discussions often must pass
through the inpatient attending to the outpatient attending. Be sure to
define how communication with this primary oncologist will be handled.

Oncology summary sentence in presentation:

1.  Cancer type and stage (at diagnosis – stage never changes even if
    progressed)
2.  Pertinent tumor genetic information
3.  Any relevant surgeries (e.g. resections)
4.  Most recent treatment
5.  Trajectory of disease (e.g. progressive, improving, or stable)
6.  Patient’s primary oncologist

Ex: Ms. X is a 64 y/o female w/ stage IIIa adenocarcinoma of the lung
post resection now with metastases to the spine (patient of Dr. Y)
admitted w/intractable back pain and leg weakness. Full NGS at diagnosis
with no actionable mutations, and was 40% positive for PDL1. No previous
chemo.
