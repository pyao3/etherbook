# Thrombocytopenia

Robert Dunn

## Background

- Platelet count <150k (mild), 50-100k (moderate), <50k (severe)
- Framework for differential: consumption, sequestration, destruction,
    production
- Causes to consider:
    - Can’t Miss Diagnoses: TTP, HUS, HELLP, DIC, HIT
    - Platelet clumping (lab artifact - pseudothrombocytopenia)
    - Splenomegaly can represent: Plt sequestration, cirrhosis, portal
        hypertension
    - Drug-induced: (Antibiotics, heparin, chemo, GpIIb/IIIa antagonists,
        H2-antagonists)
    - Rheumatologic cause – SLE, sarcoidosis, scleroderma renal crisis
    - Sepsis, independent of DIC
    - Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a diagnosis of exclusion
    - Massive physiologic consumption: large hematoma, active hemorrhage
    - Cirrhosis – results in low thrombopoietin (TPO) and increased
        clearance
    - Chronic alcohol use – direct marrow suppression
    - Infections: HIV, HCV, EBV, Parvovirus, Rickettsia, H. pylori, CMV
    - Bone marrow failure: aplastic anemia, MDS, leukemia, chemotherapy
    - Dilutional: fluid resuscitation and massive transfusion

## Presentation

- Petechiae – typically begins distally on lower legs (in mouth = wet
    purpura), seen when \<10-20k
- Overt bleeding, mucosal bleeding, epistaxis (seen when \<20k)

## Evaluation

- CMP, CBC w/diff, peripheral smear, citrated platelet count, immature
    platelet fraction (IPF)
- LDH, Fibrinogen, d-dimer, PT/aPTT
- Determine timing of decline as well as prior values
- Look at other cell lines - never normal to have two cytopenia’s
- Review recent initiation of drugs: (heparin, antibiotics, and
    chemotherapy)
- Consider abdominal ultrasound to look for splenomegaly and liver
    pathology
- Infectious work up (HIV, HCV)
- Calculate 4T Score and consider your pretest probability for HIT
    testing
- HIT Ab: ELISA is first test – only run once/day at VUMC so order
    early if considering
- Reflex Serotonin release assay (SRA) for confirmation (VUMC performs
    reflexive testing)

## Management

- Plt <50k
    - Discontinue pharmacologic DVT prophylaxis (unless HIT)
    - If on anticoagulation: consider risk/benefits of continued
        anticoagulation
        - Can transfuse plt’s if AC is mandatory
- Plt <10k
    - Transfuse platelets given risk of spontaneous intracranial
        hemorrhage
    - In pt’s with HIT or TTP, there is theoretical concern that
        transfusing plt can “fuel the fire” and lead to more thrombosis, but
        if there is active bleeding then consider platelets
        - Therefore, bleeding with HIT or TTP, discuss with Hematology
            before transfusion
- HIT
    - If pretest probability is high or HIT is confirmed
    - Stop Unfractionated and low molecular weight heparin products
    - Start Argatroban gtt
- If schistocytes present on peripheral smear = concern for TTP
    - Draw ADAMTS13
    - Contact Nephrology and Hematology for PLEX

## Additional Information

- Clumping on lab draws:
    - Obtain Citrated platelet (“blue top” tube – CPRS refers to it as a
        blue top platelet count)
    - If no resolution, obtain a "Gold top" LAB 301 in Epic (Named: Plt
        count) (ACD tube)
