# Leukocytosis

## Background

- Common progenitor cells (stem cells) are located in the bone marrow
    and give rise to erythrocytes, myeloblasts, megakaryoblasts
- Normal WBC can vary by age and pregnancy, for the purpose of this
    section will assume this is for an average, non-pregnant adult
- Chronic mild neutrophilic leukocytosis (10-20k) is common with
    tobacco use and obesity, both due to mechanisms related to chronic
    inflammation
- Reactive (typically 11k-30k) - surgery, exercise, trauma, burns,
    emotional stress
- Leukemoid reaction (typically 50k-100k) - severe infections
    (fulminant *C difficile*), organ rejection
- If greater than 100k, think leukemia or myeloproliferative disorder

## Evaluation

- Neutrophilia (neutrophil count >7k)
    - Bacterial infection, pregnancy, rheumatologic disease, steroids,
    beta agonists, lithium, colony-stimulating factors, splenectomy or
    functional asplenia, congenital (hereditary/chronic idiopathic
    neutrophilia), Down syndrome, leukocyte adhesion deficiency,
    malignancy, smoking, obesity
- Lymphocytosis (>40% of WBC count or >4,500k/mm<sup>3</sup>)
    - Infections (pertussis, syphilis, CMV, EBV, hepatitis A/B/C, toxo),
    hypersensitivity reactions, thyrotoxicosis, Addison's disease,
    hematologic malignancies, “reactive”
- Monocytosis (>8% of WBC count or >880/mm<sup>3</sup>)
    - Infections (TB, fungal disease, protozoa, tick-borne), autoimmune
    disease, malignancy (CMML)
- Eosinophilia (>500/mm<sup>3</sup>)
    - Hypersensitivity (asthma, urticaria, atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic
    esophagitis), drug reactions, malignancies, connective tissue
    disease, idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome, infections
    (helminths, Scarlet fever, Hansen's disease), sarcoidosis, SLE
    - Hypereosinophilia if AEC>1500, typically merits heme evaluation
    - Hypereosinophilic syndrome: AEC>1500 and organ dysfunction from
    eosinophils
- Basophilia (>100/mm<sup>3</sup>)
    - CML, thyroid disease, IBC, chronic dermatitis, infections
    (varicella)
