## Overview

For emergent transfusions:

Call the blood bank (VUMC: 615-322-2233; VA: 67025, supervisor at 67029).

For non-emergent transfusions:

VUMC:

- RNs on 10T and 11N can follow transfusion protocols for pRBCs and
    Plts – enter as a Nursing Communication or as part of the
    Hematology/Oncology Admission Order set.
- At VUMC, all special processing of blood products (such as
    irradiation) will be decided by blood bank based on special
    considerations listed in order set. Examples include: stem cell
    transplant, hematologic malignancy, or thalassemia
- Patients with frequent transfusions (e.g. sickle cell
    hemoglobinopathy) should have an RBC Extended Phenotype ordered
    (once) for minor RBC antigens to avoid immunization and antibody
    development to these proteins
- You may ask the VUMC hematology lab to email you pictures of the
    peripheral smear

VA:

Orders Tab – Blood Bank Orders – follow prompts to select
appropriate product. Must order both the blood product AND the
transfusion order (“Transfuse blood”)

- You need to specify all special processing such as irradiation
- To order a Type & Screen as a lab, you must go to Blood Bank Orders
- Type & Screen and Transfusion results are under the Blood tab in
    Results

## Red Blood Cell Transfusion

- Volume 200-300 mL per unit prbc
- In general, 1 unit of packed RBCs increases Hgb by 1g/dL and HCT by ~3%
- Assessment of the post-transfusion Hgb can be performed 15 min
    following transfusion, but ideally 1 hour after completion

Indications:

- Hgb <9-10 g/dL – Acute coronary syndrome
- Hgb <8 g/dL or Hct <25 – Bone marrow failure or receiving
    antineoplastic therapy
- Also sometimes used in pts with pre-existing CAD
- Hgb <7 g/dL or Hct <21 – ICU, GI Bleeding, Oncology patient on
    treatment

## Platelet Transfusion

Indications:

- <11 k/µL – all patients, reduce risk of spontaneous hemorrhage (use
    on BMT, Brittingham)
- <50 k/µL – active bleeding, scheduled to undergo select invasive
    procedure
- <100 k/µL – CNS hemorrhage, intrathecal catheter
    - This is also the threshold used for most Neurosurgical procedures

## Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) & Cryoprecipitate (Cryo)

Cryoprecipitate

- FFP enriched for von Willebrand factor, factor VIII, factor XIII,
    and fibrinogen

FFP

- Once thawed, must be used in 24 hrs (due to decline in labile
    coagulation factors)
- Must be ABO compatible but not crossmatched or Rh typing
- Only administer FFP if INR ≥1.7 (the INR of FFP is ~1.7, so FFP will not fix an INR < 1.7)

Indications:

- Bleeding:
    - FFP If INR >1.7
    - Cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen <100.
- DIC:
    - Fibrinogen <100: Transfuse 5 – 10 units cryoprecipitate and repeat
        fibrinogen. If bleeding, consider raising transfusion threshold of
        cryoprecipitate to fibrinogen <150
    - For elevated INR, consider FFP transfusion. Thresholds for doing
        this vary by attending
- Cirrhosis:
- General concept: PT/INR, aPTT are unreliable markers for bleeding.
    Fibrinogen ≤100 – 120 or thromboelastography are better surrogates
    for bleeding risk
- Transfuse fibrinogen ≤100 – 120 if the patient is actively bleeding
    or about to undergo a procedure or surgery other than paracentesis
- Transfuse FFP based on hepatology team preference (generally few
    indications for FFP)

## Transfusion Premedication & Reactions

- If you are concerned about a serious transfusion reaction, pause the
    transfusion and contact the blood bank asap
- Order the transfusion reaction blood testing in Epic. You will send
    a CBC, the bag of blood products, and the completed form to the
    blood bank for analysis

Premedication:

- Only if history of severe reaction
- Diphenhydramine 25-50mg IV
- Acetaminophen 650 mg PO
- Meperidine 25-50 mg IV (optional for chills)
- Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV (optional, for severe reactions or reactions
    despite acetaminophen and diphenhydramine)
