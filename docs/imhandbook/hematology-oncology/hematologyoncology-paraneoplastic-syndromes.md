## Hypercalcemia of malignancy

### Background

- Caused by PTHrP production, osteolytic lesions, and/or rarely
    exogenous Vit D
- PTHrP: Breast cancer, NSCLC (squamous)
- Osteolysis: Multiple Myeloma, Breast Cancer
- Exogenous Vit D: Lymphoma

### Evaluation

- Correct \[Ca+2\] for hypoalbuminemia: add 0.8 x (4.0 – albumin)
- Send basic hyperCa+2 work-up – PTH, Vit D, etc. (see hypercalcemia
    section)
- PTHrP is called “Parathyroid Hormone-related Peptide-ARUP” in Epic

### Management

- First-line: IVF without calcium such as Normosol; goal urinary
    output of 150-200 mL/hr
- Strict I/Os; Cautious IV fluids if pt w/cardiac or renal dysfunction
- Add Furosemide if hypervolemic (do not empirically start)
- Second-line: Zoledronic acid 4mg IV (takes 24-48 hours to see
    effect)
- AMS or severe hypercalcemia (>14mg/dL): calcitonin 4 IU/kg (req.
    attending approval)

## SIADH

### Background

- Euvolemic hypotonic hyponatremia with urine sodium >20 and
    typically urine Osm >100
- Associated with: SCLC (most common), head/neck cancers, breast
    cancer
- See "Nephrology" for additional information

### Management

- Free water restriction to 800mL/day
- Refractory: salt supplementation (e.g. salt tabs) +/- loop diuretic

## Carcinoid Syndrome

### Background

- Episodic flushing, diarrhea, wheezing/SOB due to secretion of
    histamine & serotonin
- Most common: Neuroendocrine tumors – GI (often with mets to liver
    and lung)

### Evaluation

- Urine: UR 5-HIAA (ARUP)
- Imaging to identify tumor(s) (CT chest/abdomen/pelvis)

### Management

- Short-term treatment: subQ or IV octreotide (see UpToDate for
    dosing)
- Antidiarrheals (Imodium, Lomotil, etc.) to slow transit
- Long-term treatment: depot (IM) forms of octreotide and lanreotide

## Autoimmune encephalitis, encephalomyelitis, and myelitis

### Background

- Encephalopathy (limbic or brainstem), +/- myelitis (limb ataxia,
    sensory deficits)
- Associated with small cell lung cancer and checkpoint inhibitor
    therapy

### Evaluation

- LP: make sure to order CSF oligoclonal bands & CSF IgG index
- “Paraneoplastic AutoAb Eval-MAYO” (add "CSF" to the front of the
    order name if for LP)
- NMDA-R can be ordered as a standalone test
- CT head
- EEG if concern for subclinical seizures

### Management

- Consult Neurology, for possible immunosuppressive therapy (steroids,
    IVIG)

## Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS)

### Background

- Muscle weakness due to autoantibody against calcium channels
    resulting in ↓ ACh release
- Associated with SCLC (most common) & lymphoma

### Presentation

- Proximal muscle weakness, diminished DTRs

### Evaluation

- Nerve conduction studies: EMG w/ NCV
- Serum “Paraneoplastic AutoAb Eval-MAYO”

### Management

- Consult Neurology
