# Hypercoagulable States

Chris Cann

---

## Background

- Virchow’s triad: 1. Hypercoagulability 2. Stasis 3. Endothelial
    injury
- Diagnostic thrombophilia testing indications:
    - Idiopathic or recurrent VTE
    - First VTE at <40 years old
    - VTE in the setting of strong family history
    - VTE in unusual vascular site (cerebral, renal, mesenteric)
    - Recurrent pregnancy loss
- Must consider if thrombophilia testing will change clinical
    management
- If the unprovoked VTE warrants indefinite anticoagulation then
    testing may not be helpful
- However, if VTE provoked by minor risk factor (OCPs) with an
    underlying thrombophilia might change the decision, then testing may
    be informative
- Separated into Acquired and Hereditary conditions:
    - Hereditary: Factor V Leiden mutation, Prothrombin mutation, Protein
        C or S deficiency, Antithrombin deficiency
    - Acquired:
        - Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APLS)
        - Heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)
        - Major surgery/trauma
        - Nephrotic Syndrome
        - Smoking
        - Pregnancy
        - Oral Contraceptives
        - Immobilization (bedridden, hip/knee replacement)
        - Active malignancy
        - Estrogen replacement therapy
        - Note: Travel (plane, train, automobile) is NOT on this list and
            this is NOT considered a provoking risk factor
    - Testing: all specific testing for hereditary disorders and APS
        should be performed at least 4-6 weeks after an acute thrombotic
        event or discontinuation of anticoagulant/thrombolytic therapies to
        avoid interference

## Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APLS)

### Background

- Most common acquired disorder (anti-phospholipid antibodies present
    in 3-5% population)
- Recurrent pregnancy loss, provoked DVT in young, unprovoked VTE and
    arterial thrombosis in young, thrombosis unusual sites, thrombosis
    in autoimmune disease
- This is a clinicopathologic diagnosis (need both clinical and
    laboratory criteria)

### Evaluation

- Positive for at least 1 lab criterion on at least 2 occasions, at
    least 12 weeks apart:
    - Lupus anticoagulant: can occur in relation to drugs or infection;
        transient are associated with thrombotic risk
    - Anticardiolipin antibodies
    - B2GP1 (anti-beta2-glycoprotein) antibodies
- Must also meet at least 1 of the following clinical criteria:
    - Vascular thrombosis: DVT, arterial thrombosis, or small vessel
        thrombosis of any organ
    - Pregnancy loss: there are specific criteria for this – consult
        UpToDate or other resource

### Management

- Aspirin for primary prevention; warfarin for treatment (INR 2-3)
- Do NOT use DOACs for triple positive APLS (see TRAPS trial:
    rivaroxaban inferior to warfarin)
- Rituximab for recurrent thrombosis despite anticoagulation
    (controversial) – call hematology

## Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)

Type 1: Mild and self-limited (not immune-mediated)

- Occurs within the first 2 days of first-time exposure
- Platelet count normalizes with continued heparin therapy

Type 2 (what we typically refer to as HIT): Immune mediated

- Fall in plt 30% to over 50% (even if plt count >150) and/or
    thrombotic event has occurred
- 4-10 days after new exposure to heparin derivative OR≤
- 1 day after restarting heparin derivative that had been used 30-100
    days prior
    - If exposed to heparin within 100 days, will have platelet drop
        within 24 hr
- Frequency: unfractionated heparin > LMWH; Surgical wards > medical
    wards
- 50% will have thrombotic event in 30 days if HIT is untreated, with
    20% mortality
- Arterial thrombi are common in HIT
- HIT results from antibodies to complexes of platelet factor 4 (PF4)
    and heparin, further activating platelets (the activated platelets
    aggregate causing thrombocytopenia)

### Evaluation

- 4T score (0-8 points):
    - Thrombocytopenia (0-2 pts): degree and nadir of platelet count drop
    - Timing (0-2 pts): timing of fall after initial or recurrent heparin
        exposure
    - Thrombosis (0-2 pts): thrombosis, skin necrosis, non-necrotizing
        lesions, acute systemic reaction to heparin
    - Other causes of thrombocytopenia (0-2 pts): more points if no
        alternate cause
- Solid-phase ELISA for heparin-PF4 antibodies:
    - 0.2-0.4 is indeterminate
    - > 0.4 is positive
    - > 1.4 HIT is likely
    - > 2 confirms HIT
    - The lab at VUMC will perform functional SRA reflexively for all
        values >0.2

### Management

- 0-3 points: Low concern for HIT; can restart heparin
- 4-5 points: Intermediate probability (~10%) - hold heparin, start
    non-heparin anticoagulant
- 6 points: High probability (~50%) - hold heparin, start non-heparin
    anticoagulant
- Argatroban (direct thrombin inhibitor) for prophylaxis and treatment
    of thrombosis
- Avoid platelet transfusions as can increase thrombogenic effect
- Avoid warfarin until complete platelet recovery as may cause
    microthrombosis
- Hematology consult for all confirmed HIT

## Factor V Leiden mutation

### Evaluation

- Activated protein C resistance assay
    - APC ratio in patient vs normal
    - normal >2.0, heterozygotes 1.5-2.0, homozygotes <1.5
- FVL mutation is then determined via PCR
- Screen with APC assay rather than PCR initially; cost effective

### Management

- VTE treatment same as general population
- VTE 4-8x risk in heterozygotes; 80x risk in homozygotes
- Avoid OCPs: increased risk for VTE

## Prothrombin gene mutation

### Evaluation:

- PCR of G20210A mutation (2-4% prevalence)

### Management:

- VTE treatment same as general population & avoid OCPs

## Protein C & S Deficiency

### Background

- Autosomal dominant; first event occurs between 10-50 years of age
- Synthesized in liver and Vit K dependent, therefore low levels in
    hepatic dysfunction and warfarin use/vitamin K deficiency
- Protein C: low in settings of thrombosis, DIC, nephrotic syndrome,
    intra/post-op
- Protein S: low in infectious (HIV) and autoimmune processes (IBD)
- Protein S decreases during pregnancy (decreased free Protein S,
    normal total Protein S)
- Do not misdiagnose a pregnant patient with PS deficiency

### Evaluation

- Functional Protein C & S assays

### Management

- VTE treatment same as general population
- Avoid OCPs
- High risk patients may require protein C concentrate prior to
    surgery
- Increased risk of warfarin-induced skin necrosis

## Antithrombin deficiency

### Background

- Autosomal dominant, does not skip generations
- VTE in unusual sites (cerebral sinuses, renal veins)
- Present < 50 y/o, but rarely in first two decades
- Decreased in liver disease, nephrotic syndrome, protein losing
    enteropathy, burn, trauma, bypass surgery, metastatic tumors,
    premenopausal, OCP use, pregnancy

### Evaluation

- Functional antithrombin activity (AT-heparin cofactor assay)
- Then perform antigen quantity testing

### Management

- Can use Argatroban as does not require antithrombin function
- Warfarin preferred in VTE (titrate up based on expression of
    antithrombin deficiency)
