# Sickle Cell Crisis

Michael J. Neuss

---

## Background

- Present with severe pain in bone, joints, chest, abdomen
- Causes: (HIDISC) Hypoxia, Ischemia, Dehydration, Infection, Stress,
    Cold
- Can’t Miss:
    - Acute chest: hypoxia + fever + chest pain + new infiltrate on CXR
        (consult benign hematology immediately, do not wait until the next
        day)
    - PE (ACS less likely in these patients); avascular necrosis of hip,
        priapism, stroke

## Evaluation

- Labs: LDH (high), Hgb/Hct (low; check vs baseline), retic, smear,
    WBC
- If febrile: UA + Blood cultures
- Send Hgb S level, and compare to baseline w/ other hospital
    admissions
- Imaging: CXR, MRI for hip pain, Abdominal U/S or CT abdomen
- Maintain active type and cross given probability of antibodies

## Management

- General:
    - Look for a care coordination yellow note in the Summary Tab
        - Heme clinic will have specific management preferences for
            individual patients
    - Maintain hydration, IVF at 150-200 cc/hr (if no contraindication)
    - Oxygen: goal sat ~95% (higher O2 goal will help to prevent further
        sickling!)
    - Continue folic acid 1 mg qDay
    - Continue hydroxyurea if uncomplicated pain crisis
        - Hold if counts suppressed or concern for infection
    - If in the MICU: consider discussion for plasma exchange (if Hgb SS
        or SC or S-Thal)
    - Transfuse: Simple transfusion if Hgb lower than baseline and/or
        complications
        - Avoid transfusions when able, given risk of antibody formation
- Pain:
    - Will generally require opiates, likely initiation of PCA
    - All SS patients should have pain plans; inpatient pain plans are in
        the problem list under sickle cell disease or in the care
        coordination section of Epic
    - Outpatient plans (to which you will transition pts back prior to
        discharge) are not standardized in location, but can be under Media
        (with a pain contract) or found in notes
- Acute chest:
    - Consult Hematology at time of admission
    - D5 1/2 NS @ 150-250 cc/hr
    - Transfuse hgb to >10
    - PCA w/ dilaudid
    - Abx for CAP (vs HAP if risk factors) ± bronchodilators
