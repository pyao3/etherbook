# Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPNs)

Christina Snider

---

## Background

- MPNs = chronic myeloid disorders caused by abnormal proliferation of
    mature bone marrow cell lineages (granulocytes, erythrocytes, or
    megakaryocytes)
- MPNs differ from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS); cells in MPNs are
    normally developed (i.e. not dysplastic)
- Four “classic” MPNs: polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia,
    primary myelofibrosis and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)

## Polycythemia Vera (PV)

### Background

- Polycythemia is a general term: Men = Hb/Hct > 16.5/49%; Women =
    Hb/Hct > 16/48%
- Relative polycythemia = Concentrated H/H due to decreased plasma
    volume
    - Diuretic use, vomiting, diarrhea; H/H should normalize with fluid
        resuscitation
- Absolute polycythemia = Increased RBC mass
- Primary polycythemia: 2/2 Inherited/acquired mutation in RBC
    progenitor
- Secondary polycythemia: Increase in RBC mass due to elevated serum
    EPO
    - Hypoxia/cardiopulmonary associated (chronic pulmonary disease,
        R-to-L cardiac shunts, sleep apnea, obesity hypoventilation
        syndrome, chronic carbon monoxide poisoning, including heavy
        smoking)
    - Kidney associated causes (following renal transplant, renal
        artery stenosis, hydronephrosis)
    - Autonomous EPO production from an EPO-producing tumors (rare)
    - Steroid Use

- Epidemiology: Median age of diagnosis is 60 years; 25% cases present
    at age <50 years.
- >95% PV pts have JAK2 V617F mutation, but JAK2 V617F mutation is
    not specific to PV and can be seen in other MPNs

### Presentation

- Incidentally elevated H/H
- Splenomegaly, generalized pruritus (post-warm bath/shower), unusual
    thrombosis
- Erythromelalgia: intermittent occurrence of red, hot, painful
    extremities

### Evaluation

- CBC with differential and peripheral smear
- EPO level
- Rule out secondary causes: Sleep Study, Carboxyhemoglobin, steroids
- Peripheral blood screen for JAK2 V617F mutation

### Management

- PV treatment aims to prevent thrombosis and bleeding events.
- Phlebotomy: maintain Hct <45% (One unit 500 mL decreases Hct by 3%)
- ASA 81 mg for thrombosis prevention and symptom control
- Hydroxyurea: indicated for high-risk patients (>60 years old or
    with history of thrombosis)
- Interferon-alfa, busulfan, or ruxolitinib: indicated in select
    high-risk patients

## Essential thrombocythemia (ET)

### Background

- Clonal stem cell disorder w/ increased platelet counts (>450k/uL)
- Risks of thrombosis and hemorrhage
- Median age of diagnosis: 60 years; Twice as common in females.

### Presentation

- Incidental thrombocytosis on CBC
- Splenomegaly, unusual thrombosis, and erythromelalgia

### Evaluation

- Screen for conditions that cause reactive thrombocytosis: Chronic
    inflammatory diseases, infections, bleeding/hemolysis, iron
    deficiency, post splenectomy
- CBC with smear (platelet anisocytosis) ranging from very small to
    giant platelets
- CMP, LDH, Uric Acid, iron studies
- BCR ABL1 testing should be sent to exclude CML
- Bone marrow biopsy with staining, cytogenetics, and molecular
    testing for JAK2, CALR, MPL mutations

### Management

- Avoid ASA 81 in patients with platelet counts >1 million
    complicated by acquired von Willebrand syndrome due to increased
    risk of bleeding

## Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF)

### Background

- Clonal proliferation of myeloid cells with variable morphologic
    maturity resulting in reactive marrow fibrosis and extramedullary
    hematopoiesis
- Least favorable prognosis out of MPN

### Presentation

- Fatigue, weight loss, low grade fever, bone pain, and night sweats
- Marked splenomegaly +/-hepatomegaly (due to extramedullary
    hematopoiesis)

### Evaluation

- smear: teardrop shaped RBCs (dacrocytes)
- Bone marrow biopsy: “dry tap” due to extensive reticulin and/or
    collagen fibrosis mutually exclusive mutations in JAK2, MPL, or CALR

### Management

- Low risk patients: Observe if asymptomatic
- Cure by allogenic HCT transplantation in young, high-risk patients
- Treatment of anemias include transfusion support
- Surgical splenectomy if abdominal pain or transfusion dependent
    anemia (used very infrequently)

## Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML)

### Background

- Definition: MPN characterized by the overproduction of myeloid stem
    cells that can differentiate
- Chronic phase:
    - Fatigue, weight loss, bleeding
    - Abdominal fullness and early satiety due to splenomegaly
    - WBC on CBC is typically >100k, and smear shows neutrophilic cells
        in all stages of maturation with <2% blasts
- Accelerated phase: Refractory leukocytosis, 10-19% blasts in
    peripheral blood or bone marrow, worsening peripheral basophilia,
    thrombocytopenia
- Blast phase = acute leukemia. >20% blasts in peripheral blood or
    bone marrow, extramedullary proliferation of blasts

### Evaluation

- Typical findings in blood and bone marrow and confirmation of
    Philadelphia chromosome (BCR-ABL1 fusion gene) via conventional
    cytogenetics, FISH, or rt-PCR

### Management

- Hydroxyurea can be used to reduce WBC while awaiting confirmation
- Oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIS): Imatinib, dasatinib,
    nilotinib, and ponatinib
- Allogenic hematopoietic cell transplantation: Curative option for
    pts in accelerated and blast phase, as well as young pts w/chronic
    phase CML who do not respond to TKI therapy
