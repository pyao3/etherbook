# Plasma Cell Dyscrasias

Rahul Shah, Jennifer Marvin-Peek

---

## Background

- A heterogenous group of benign, premalignant, and malignant
    conditions characterized by clonal proliferation of plasma cells
- Results in over-production of monoclonal immunoglobulins or
    polypeptides (i.e., M-protein) that can be detected in serum and/or
    urine
- Includes monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS),
    smoldering myeloma (SMM), multiple myeloma (MM), Waldenström
    Macroglobulinemia (WM), extra-medullary plasmacytoma, AL
    amyloidosis, POEMS syndrome
- Spectrum of MGUS, SMM, and MM represents natural progression of same
    disease process
- Complications: Increased infectious risk, cytopenias, renal failure,
    hyperviscosity syndrome, malignant hypercalcemia, pain crisis from
    bony disease
- Elevated gamma/protein gap (serum total protein minus albumin \>4)
    often prompts work-up for an underlying plasma cell dyscrasia (high
    specificity but low sensitivity)

## Evaluation

- CBC w/ diff, peripheral blood smear, CMP (for Ca, Cr, albumin), LDH,
    CRP, urinalysis
- SPEP with immunofixation, UPEP (24-hour urine) with immunofixation,
    serum free light chains (FLC)
- Quantitative immunoglobulins (IgA, IgM, IgG, IgD, IgE)
- If Hgb <10, Cr >2, Ca >11.5, M-protein >1.5, non-IgG M-spike,
    abnormal FLC ratio:
- Bone marrow biopsy + cytogenetics
- β2-microglobulin, serum viscosity (in WM)
- Skeletal imaging to identify bone lesions: skeletal survey (x-ray)
    often done initially, then more sensitive CT/PET-CT/MRI if biopsy
    shows SMM/MM
- If considering amyloidosis: abdominal wall fat pad biopsy with Congo
    red staining typically sufficient
    (call pathology to arrange, can typically be done same-day or next-day)
    vs direct biopsy of amyloid-involved tissue

## Multiple Myeloma

### Evaluation

- Diagnosis requires clonal bone marrow plasma cells ≥10% or
    bony/extramedullary plasmacytoma AND one or more end-organ event
    (CRAB criteria) or biomarker of myeloma
- CRAB criteria
    - Hypercalcemia, renal impairment, anemia, bone osteolytic lesions
- Biomarkers of multiple myeloma
    - Clonal bone marrow plasma cells ≥ 60%
    - Serum FLC ratio ≥ 100 or ≤ 0.01
    - >1 focal lesion ≥ 5mm on MRI
- Skeletal imaging: Whole-body PET-CT or CT preferred, MRI, bone
    survey (x-ray)

### Management

- First-line induction therapy typically is RVd: immunomodulatory
    agent (lenalidomide \[<u>R</u>evlimid\]), proteasome inhibitor
    (bortezomib \[<u>V</u>elcade\]) and <u>d</u>examethasone
- Consolidation therapy includes autologous SCT for transplant
    eligible patients
- Maintenance therapy is often given indefinitely, typically
    lenalidomide or bortezomib
- Relapsed disease is often treated with anti-CD38 monoclonal Ab
    (daratumumab) with a steroid and either immunomodulatory drug or
    proteosome inhibitor; CAR-T also recently approved for relapsed MM
- Supportive Care
    - VTE prophylaxis with DOAC or LMWH if on an immunomodulatory agent
        with 2 VTE risk factors; if only 0-1 VTE risk factors, aspirin
    - EPO and G-CSF for treatment-related anemia and neutropenia
    - Bisphosphonate (ideally zoledronic acid) to reduce risk of
        fractures; analgesia ± radiotherapy for bone pain and palliation
    - (Val)acyclovir if on bortezomib for VZV prophylaxis

## Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma/Waldenström Macroglobulinemia (IgM)

### Presentation

- Hyperviscosity syndrome: blurred vision, dizziness, diplopia,
    hypoxia, ataxia, vertigo, stroke, coma
- Peripheral neuropathy
- Retinal changes: dilated veins, hemorrhages, papilledema
- Cryoglobulinemia: large IgM complexes precipitate out in the cold,
    causing Raynaud's, urticaria, purpura, acral cyanosis, tissue
    necrosis

### Evaluation

- Requires: IgM monoclonal gammopathy on SPEP, BM biopsy w/≥10%
    lymphocytes with plasmacytoid differentiation (late stage B-cell
    differentiation), and MYD88 mutation detected
- CBC, coagulation studies, cryoglobulins, IgM, β2-microglobulin
- Serum viscosity (If <4 symptoms are rare, If >6 typically
    symptomatic)

### Management

- Asymptomatic patients managed with close observation
- Symptomatic hyperviscosity is treated with plasmapheresis
- Induction: may include bendamustine +/- rituximab if IgM level is
    <4000 (Rituximab can temporarily ↑ IgM and ↑ risk of hyperviscosity
    syndrome)
- Monitor response with: IgM levels, monoclonal IgM on SPEP

## Other Plasma Cell Dyscrasias

### Light Chain (AL) Amyloidosis

- Extracellular deposition of misfolded light chains (most commonly
    kidney & heart)
- Features: nephrotic syndrome, restrictive CM, peripheral neuropathy,
    HSM, macroglossia, easy bruising/bleeding,
    dysautonomia/orthostasis
- Diagnosis:
    - Need ALL 4: amyloid related systemic syndrome, positive congo
        red staining on any tissue, evidence that amyloid is light
        chain related, evidence of monoclonal plasma cell disorder

### POEMS Syndrome

- Cause unknown, possibly chronic overproduction of pro-inflammatory
    cytokines such as VEGF
- Features: Polyneuropathy, Organomegaly, Endocrinopathy, Monoclonal
    protein (usually λ light chain), Skin changes
- Diagnosis:
    - Mandatory Criteria: peripheral neuropathy, monoclonal plasma cell
        disorder
    - Major Criteria (need 1/3): osteosclerotic lesions, VEGF, Castleman
        disease
    - Minor Criteria (need 1/6): organomegaly, volume overload,
        endocrinopathy, skin changes, papilledema, thrombocytosis or
        polycythemia

### Castleman Disease

- Angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia
- Antibodies to HHV-8 implicated in >50% of cases
- Features: Lymphadenopathy, fever, night sweats, fatigue, fluid
    accumulation, violaceous lymph node biopsy w/ characteristic
    hematopathology papules
