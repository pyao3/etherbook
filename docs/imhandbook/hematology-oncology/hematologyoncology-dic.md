# Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)

## Background

- Concurrent activation of the coagulation pathway and fibrinolytic
    pathway
- Consumption of platelets, fibrin, and coagulation factors
    fibrinolysis end organ damage and hemolysis
- Etiologies:
    - Infection/Sepsis, Liver disease, Pancreatitis, Trauma
    - Malignancies: mucin-secreting pancreatic/gastric adenocarcinoma,
        brain tumors, prostate cancer, all acute leukemias, acute
        promyelocytic leukemia
    - Obstetric complications (i.e. preeclampsia/eclampsia, placental
        abruption)
    - Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (i.e. ABO incompatible
        transfusion)

## Evaluation

- Exam: petechiae, bleeding (mucosal, IV site, surgical wound site,
    hematuria), ecchymoses, thrombosis (i.e. cold, pulseless
    extremities)
- CBC, PT/INR, aPTT, Fibrinogen, D-Dimer, Peripheral Blood Smear
- “DIC labs” = q6h fibrinogen, PT/INR, aPTT (space out when lower
    risk)
- Findings suggestive of DIC: thrombocytopenia, prolonged aPTT and
    PT/INR, hypofibrinogenemia, elevated D-dimer, fibrin degradation
    products, schistocytes

## Management

- Treat the underlying cause!
- Vitamin K for INR > 1.7 or bleeding
- Hypofibrinogenemia treatment: Cryoprecipitate 5-10 units if
    fibrinogen < 100
- Thrombocytopenia treatment: plt transfusion as normally indicated
- DVT ppx if not bleeding and plt > 50
- VTE: anticoagulation if plt > 50 and no massive bleeding
