# Pancytopenia

## Background

- Framework for differential:
    - Impaired production (aplastic anemia, marrow infiltration, marrow
        suppression, vitamin/nutritional deficiencies, sepsis, cirrhosis)
    - Peripheral destruction (autoimmune hemolytic, hypersplenism)
    - Combined process (PNH, SLE, leukemia, HLH, infections)

## Evaluation

- Medications: NSAIDs, AEDs, steroids, chemotherapy, antivirals,
    immunosuppression
- PMHx: autoimmune disease (SLE, RA), radiation, gastric surgery,
    malabsorption, liver disease, hematologic malignancy
- Social Hx: EtOH use, malnutrition, occupational exposures, exposures
    to TB or leishmaniasis
- Exam: lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, neuropathy, petechiae,
    stigmata of liver disease, cachexia
- Diagnostic studies: CBC w/ diff, CMP, reticulocyte count, peripheral
    smear, viral studies (hepatitis A/B/C, EBV, CMV, HIV, parvovirus
    B19), vitamin levels (B12, folate, copper, zinc), iron studies,
    hemolysis labs (LDH, haptoglobin, Coombs), flow cytometry, bone
    marrow biopsy, cytogenetics and FISH

## Management

- For pancytopenia that is acute (hospital onset) often observation is
    the best approach
- When pancytopenia is slow, progressive over time, or acute without
    any other precipitating factors then would consult hematology for
    consideration of a bone marrow syndromes
