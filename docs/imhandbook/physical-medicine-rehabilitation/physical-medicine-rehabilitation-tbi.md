# Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) 

Jake Dovgan and Doug Bryant

## Background

- TBI is categorized as a disruption in brain function leading to
    decreased consciousness, memory deficits, neurological deficits, or
    intracranial lesion.

- This disruption is a result of an external blow or force.

- Most common causes of TBI are falls and MVC.

- Falls are the most common cause of TBI in elderly population.

## Assessment

- Mechanism of injury

- Initial GCS

- Loss of consciousness and duration

- Other injuries

- Initial evaluation should include a non-contrasted head CT to rule
    out hemorrhage

- Full neuro exam including but not limited to cranial nerves,
    strength, cognition (orientation), memory, reflexes, sensation,
    cerebellar testing, range of motion of joints, Babinski, and
    Hoffmann's

## Classification

| Severity | GCS   | Post-Traumatic Amnesia | Loss of Consciousness       |
|----------|-------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Mild     | 13-15 | \<1 day                | \<30 minutes                |
| Moderate | 9-12  | 1 day to 7 days        | \>30 minutes and \<24 hours |
| Severe   | 3-8   | \>1 week               | \> 24 hours                 |

## Evaluation and Management

- Secondary complications following TBI:

    - In the acute setting, patients who have had a TBI are at risk for
        seizures, agitation, autonomic problems, bowel/bladder, wounds,
        vertigo, headaches, and cognitive impairment, venous thrombosis, and
        spasticity

- If concerned about TBI would consult PM&R and Speech Therapy for
    assistance in management of complications and assessment of
    cognition.

- If concerned for spasticity refer to “Spasticity section” for
    specific medication recommendations.
