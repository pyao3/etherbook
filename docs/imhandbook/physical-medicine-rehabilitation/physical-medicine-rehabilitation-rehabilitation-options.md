**Physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&R)** physicians focus on
restoring function and quality of life to those with physical
impairments or disabilities affecting the brain, spinal cord, nerves,
bones, joints, ligaments, muscles, and tendons

**Physiatrists** specialize in determining appropriate rehab options for
hospitalized patients

## Acute Inpatient Rehabilitation (IPR) or Inpatient Rehabilitation
facility (IRF):

- IPR involves a multidisciplinary team of physicians, physical
    therapists, occupational therapists, speech and language
    pathologists

- Pts admitted to IPR must be able to tolerate a minimum of 3 hours of
    rehab per day for 5 days a week

- Pts must have medical complexity warranting medical supervision by a
    physician

- Physicians are required to evaluate admitted patients at least 3
    times a week

- Average length of stay (LOS) in acute inpatient rehab is 10-12 days

## Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF):

    - Patients admitted to SNF require skilled needs: Wound care, IV
        therapy, Catheter care, PT, OT, and/or SLP

    - There are no minimal requirements for daily therapy, but patients
        may receive up to 1.5 hours/day, depending on availability at the
        facility (in practice it is often less than this)

    - Physicians are required to evaluate admitted patients at least once
        every 30 days

    - Average length of stay is 26 days

## Long-Term Acute Care Hospital (LTACH):

- Pts admitted to LTACH require extended hospitalization and include
    pts who will be receiving prolonged mechanical ventilation

- Pts will be recommended for transfer to an LTACH when no reasonable
    functional or medical improvement can be expected in an acute
    inpatient stay

- LTACHs can be within a hospital or may be free-standing

- Average length of stay must be greater than 25 days

## Assisted Living:

- Pts receive a combination of long-term housing, personal care
    services, and health care

- Designed for individuals who need assistance with activities of
    daily living

- Can be provided in freestanding communities, near or integrated with
    SNFs, hospitals or retirement communities

## Outpatient Services:

- Can be ordered at discharge with or without official PT/OT
    recommendations

- Home health (HH): wide range of healthcare services provided in
    patients home ranging from wound care to IV antibiotics

    - HH PT/OT: pts can receive therapy at home when unable to attend
        outpatient PT/OT

    - HH nursing services: required for IV antibiotics or PICC line
        maintenance; consider for wound care, other services include
        medication adherence and reconciliation

    - HH non-skilled aide: outside the scope of acute hospitalization, but
        helps with ADLs

- Outpatient PT/OT: Consider for those who would benefit from therapy
    but do not meet the qualifications for other dispositions or would
    prefer outpatient therapy
