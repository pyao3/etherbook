# Spasticity 

Doug Bryant and Jake Dovgan

## Background

- Spasticity is a velocity-dependent increase in resistance to passive
    stretch.

- It differs from hypertonia in that hypertonia is resistance to
    passive stretch that is not velocity-dependent.

- Spasticity is believed to result from disruption of descending
    inhibitory modulation of the alpha motor neurons by an upper motor
    lesion, producing hyperexcitability.

- Grading (by the Modified Ashworth Scale)

  - 0=no increase in tone

  - 1=slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release
      or by minimal resistance at the end of ROM when affected part is
      moved in flexion or extension

  - 1+=slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch followed by
      minimal resistance through the remainder of ROM (less than half)

  - 2=more marked increase in muscle tone through most of ROM, but
      affected part is easily moved.

  - 3=considerable increases in muscle tone; passive movement difficult

  - 4=affected part is rigid in flexion or extension

## Management

- Spasticity can have functional benefits, including improving
    standing and transfers. However, it can also cause weakness, poor
    dexterity, pain, and contractures.

- If spasticity is having undesirable effects, first line of treatment
    is PT/OT and physical modalities such as stretching.

- Oral Medications

| Medication                | Mechanism of Action                             | Side Effects/Important Considerations                                            |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Baclofen                  | GABA-B agonist                                  | sedation, fatigue, nausea, centrally acting – risk of withdrawal                 |
| Tizanidine                | Alpha-2 agonist                                 | sedation, dizziness, xerostomia, weakness, centrally acting – risk of withdrawal |
| Diazepam/ Benzodiazepines | GABA-A agonist                                  | sedation, confusion, hypotension, centrally acting – risk of withdrawal          |
| Dantrolene                | inhibits Ca release from sarcoplasmic reticulum | weakness, sedation, nausea, hepatotoxicity, acts directly on skeletal muscle     |

- Intrathecal baclofen: Reserved for patients who have significant
    side effects with oral anti-spasticity medications or who have
    severe, persistent, and diffuse spasticity despite maximal doses.

- Injections

  - Botulinum toxin: Blocks the presynaptic release of acetylcholine
      from motor endplates of the lower motor neuron at the myoneural
      junction. Effect usually lasts 3-8months

  - Alcohol block: Phenol and ethanol are neurolytic agents that can be
      used to block nerves with motor function.

- Surgeries


  - Selective dorsal rhizotomy, osteotomy, muscle tendon lengthening,
      release, or transfer

\*\*\*If a patient experiences worsening of spasticity, it is important
to consider other underlying conditions such as infections, pressure
ulcers, constipation, or bladder distention\*\*\*
