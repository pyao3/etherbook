# Code Status Discussion 

Katie Sunthankar

---

- The approach to obtaining someone’s code status should be thoughtful
    and pertinent to their current admission or recent change in
    clinical status

    - Ask yourself “Why would this patient code? Is resuscitation a
        reversible treatment in this patient’s case? What are the chances
        that this patient will survive to discharge following CPR? Is the
        anticipated outcome in line with the patient’s goals?

    - After you have made your assessment, help patient make an educated
        decision based on both the efficacy of resuscitation and the
        patient’s goals

- Below are examples of phrases that can be used in framing code
    status.

    - NEVER say “Do you want us to do everything?” Most patients will
        respond yes to this even if they do not want CPR

    - It is more helpful to give examples of when these situations would
        arise and make recommendations based on your medical judgment
        factoring in patient's goals

## Admitting a patient:

- **Introduction**: Normalize the conversation by stating “these are
    questions we routinely ask everyone when they come into the
    hospital. This is a way for us to understand your wishes in the
    event you are unable to make your own decisions.”

- **Surrogate**: “If you were unable to make decisions for yourself,
    who would you trust to make your decisions? The person you pick
    should be able to speak to your wishes and make the same choices you
    would make for yourself”

- \-**Intubation**: Always do this first so you can avoid the sticky
    DNI but not DNR situation. Again, normalize the question. “Everyone
    has different opinions on what types of medical care they would want
    if they became sicker. One of the things we like to talk about are
    ventilators or breathing machines. Some tell us to try a breathing
    machine for a trial, but they would not want to be kept alive on a
    ventilator.” Now make a recommendation. “In your case I think if you
    were to need a ventilator, I think it would \[work, not work,\]”
    Pause and allow them to ask questions. Also remember that if they
    say DNI, then they must be DNR because intubation occurs with ACLS
    (this is not allowed at VUMC. It is technically allowed at the VA if
    the patient specifically requests but would not recommend routinely
    providing this option)

- **CPR**: Prime this question with “The next question I have to ask
    you can be hard to think about, but it is important that we know
    what you would want in an emergency. Specifically, if you had a
    cardiac arrest where your heart stops beating and you die, would you
    want chest compressions to try and restart your heart? We know based
    on the evidence that CPR is not always successful. It really depends
    on the situation. In your case, I think CPR would be (make a
    recommendation here). Knowing this, would you want us to attempt CPR
    to resuscitate you?”

    - A helpful way to share data about the success of CPR: “Can I share
        some numbers about how often CPR can help?” Sometimes using fingers
        to show these numbers helps. “If you take 10 people in this hospital
        and all of their hearts stop beating, which would mean they have
        died, and we get to them as fast as possible, only 3 of them would
        have their hearts restarted and only 1 of them would ever leave the
        hospital.”

## What if you do not think performing CPR Is medically appropriate?…

- At the end of the day, it is their decision (attendings may change
    the code status out of medical futility in Tennessee)

- Code status can be revisited throughout the hospital stay,
    especially if the patient was initially overwhelmed or if their
    clinical status evolves. Sometimes patients find it helpful to have
    a family member or friend present

- Consider framing the discussion differently and offer your
    recommendation: “While you are in the hospital, we will support you
    with interventions and medications that we think are helpful based
    on what you have told us important to you. However, we are worried
    that some of the interventions you are asking for may do more harm
    than good. Many people think that CPR works like it does on TV.
    Unfortunately, we know that most patients who need CPR in the
    hospital do not survive like they do on TV. In your case, we do not
    think it would bring you back to your current state. I worry that
    this is not something that will be helpful to you.”

- Another phrase that is helpful (and when the discussion occurs with
    surrogates leads to higher rates of changing code status than saying
    DNR): “allow for a natural death”. For example, “I worry that given
    how sick your \[loved one\] is, that the additional interventions of
    CPR if she were to die, would prevent her from having a natural
    death”
