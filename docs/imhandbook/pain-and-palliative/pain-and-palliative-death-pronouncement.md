# The Death Pronouncement

Michael J. Neuss

---

This scenario arises in a variety of contexts, including the units,
wards, and cross-cover. You might know the patient and family well, but
particularly when cross covering, that may not be the case

- This approach to the death pronouncement is based in part on the
    AAFP’s “Death Pronouncement: Survival Tips for Residents” (Am Fam
    Physician. 1998 Jul 1;58(1):284-285.)

## Before Entering:

- Familiarize yourself with the most important points of the patient’s
    hospitalization and recent events. Be aware of the circumstances of
    the patient’s death, particularly whether death was expected or
    sudden.

- Inquire as to which family is present including whether the POA is
    currently at bedside

- In general, it is best to enter accompanied, ideally with the
    patient’s nurse. It is rare for the chaplain to be present but that
    might also be a consideration.

## In The Room:

- Especially when cross-covering, make sure to introduce yourself to
    family, and allow them time to introduce themselves to you

- Less is more when it comes to what you say: it can be good to be
    empathetic (consider only short statements such as “I am sorry for
    your loss”) but focus mainly on the task at hand, allowing time for
    families to be present with their loved one

- Explain that you have been called to examine the patient to confirm
    that they have passed. Allow a brief time for questions; it is rare
    (but not impossible) that someone may wish to excuse themselves for
    the pronouncement

- Note the location of a working clock when you enter; your watch is
    ok too but do make sure to avoid looking at your smartphone to check
    the time of death

## The Exam and Pronouncement

- Identify the patient by wrist band

- Confirm that the patient does not respond to stimuli; one discreet
    way to confirm a lack of response to tactile stimuli is to hold the
    hand, and apply pressure to a nailbed, appearing to hold the hand
    while looking at/visually inspecting the face or other part of the
    body

- Confirm the absence of spontaneous respirations and absence of heart
    sounds. Listen for a full minute as some patients have extended
    periods of apnea

- Examine the pupils and note the absence of pupillary light reflex

- Note the time at which your examination is completed. This is the
    time of death

- Make sure to ask if the family would like an autopsy to be
    performed. This is often overlooked, and as awkward as it might feel
    to ask for this, it is a requirement

- Make sure you have notified the attending of record

- Please see further VA- and VUMC-specific guidance below

## Death Process at VUMC

- The key thing is to ensure that all components are completed in the
    “Discharge as Deceased” tab under the Transfer-Discharge screen

- EACH AND EVERY component of this tab must be completed before
    Decedent Affairs will accept the body

Required steps:

- Cardiopulmonary Death Charting -> Select “New Reading” and
    complete.

- Cardiopulmonary Death -> Select “+Create Note”

- Medical Examiner Criteria -> Select “+New Reading”; Criteria
    requiring notification of ME is listed in a drop down menu in the
    navigator. Includes accidental deaths, threats to public health,
    suspicion for foul play, etc. The Vanderbilt Operator can assist
    with connecting you to the ME; alternatively, you can call
    615-743-1800 during business hours (M-F 8am – 4:30pm) or the
    after-hours pager at 800-216-0107.

    - All patients diagnosed with Covid are automatic ME cases

- Autopsy Criteria -> Select “+New Reading”

- Preliminary Cause of Death and Date/Time of Death ->. Rather than
    list “Cardiopulmonary arrest,” be specific (e.g., Pulmonary
    Embolism, Myocardial Infarction, Metastatic Colon Cancer, etc.)

- Deceased’s Info – Report of Death

    - If you need to leave this and return later after collecting
        information, you can access your partially complete entries by
        clicking on the date/time text that appears under the ribbon. This
        is not intuitive because the numbers listing the date/time do not at
        all appear as though they act like a hyperlink (but they do).

    - Be specific; TDS will want you to have listed the name of the family
        you notified, the TDS Case Number (which the RN typically enters),
        and your attending physician’s name (to sign the death certificate;
        give their pager number in this subsection).

- Report of Death Note -> Select “+New Reading” and complete.

- Complete Synopsis + Hospital Course and then at the very bottom
    under Summary of Death select “+Create Note.”

- Once all of this paperwork is finished, be sure to touch base with
    the patient’s nurse, usually contact Decedent Affairs and assist in
    making sure the body is moved
