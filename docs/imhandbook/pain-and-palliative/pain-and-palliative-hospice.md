# Hospice

## Background

- Hospice: aims to provide aggressive palliative care for patients at
    the end of their life, usually when life-prolonging treatment
    options have stopped
    - Eligibility: less than or equal to 6- month life expectancy
        - Consider: palliative performance scale (PPS) rating of \<50-60%,
            dependence in 3 of 6 ADL’s, alteration in nutritional status, or
            documented deterioration in 4-6 months
    - Levels of Care
        - General inpatient care: Patients must require skilled nursing
            care that could not be provided at home (IV medications,
            suction, high flow O2,) No cost to the patient under this level
            of care.
        - Home hospice-Patients are discharged to their "home”: which
            could be a long term care facility, assisted living facility, or
            their house.
    - What is covered?
        - Personnel:
            - Hospice RN visits at least weekly and as needed; crisis
                on-call visits available 24/7
            - SW, Chaplain, Hospice MD oversight
            - CNAs: usually 1 hr, 2-3/wk at most
        - Medicines for comfort
        - Medical equipment for comfort and safety including oxygen
        - Up to 13 months of bereavement for caregivers after the death
        - Respite care for 5 days, usually in a nursing home
        - Inpatient hospice at hospice facility or at certain hospitals
            for symptom control for up to 7 days
    - Hospice can be offered to patients without insurance

## VA Specifics for Hospice

- Main difference compared to VUMC is pt is allowed concurrent care
    - This means vets can continue to receive some treatments for the
        primary condition (e.g., palliative radiation or chemotherapy) and
        still receive hospice services
- Additionally, all veterans that go on hospice should have any needed
    nursing home stay (at a contracted SNF) covered by the VA regardless
    of service connection
- VA Palliative Care team will help with these referrals
- One (1) F Status at the VA
    - Designates “treating specialty” as NA-HOSPICE. Reduces costs for
        families, helps quality metrics. Use this if patient qualifies and
        agrees to hospice care
    - Write Delayed Transfer Orders: Admit to NA-HOSPICE and Specialty as
        “Hospice for Acute Care”
    - Write a nursing text order to “Change Patient to 1-F Status”

## Medications for Imminently Dying Patients

General recommendations

- At VUMC, there is a very helpful order set titled “Comfort Care
    Orders (Trauma, MICU, SICU, NEURO ICU, Palliative Care”
- Make sure to remove unnecessary medications, labs, telemetry,
    nursing text orders, etc.

## Pain

- Morphine 2mg IV or SQ q1h PRN (avoid if renal failure)
- Hydromorphone 0.25 – 0.5mg IV or SQ q1h PRN
- Write as PRN, as needed for pain \> 2/10 or for air hunger
- If ineffective after 1 hours, increase by 50-100%
- If given every hour for 3-4 hours, consider an infusion (given PRN
    dose as hourly rate)
- Fentanyl is not a great option in ICU unless it is a continuous
    drip. Bolus lasts only 15 mins

## Dyspnea/Tachypnea

- Assess for volume overload, considering decrease or stopping IVFs or
    tube feeds
- Opioids are the treatment of choice for dyspnea
- Consider Benzodiazepines for air hunger not controlled by opiates
- Supplemental oxygen for comfort (do not base on O2 sat). Consider
    use of cool air or fan

## Restlessness/agitation/anxiety

- Assess for urinary retention, constipation, pain, other modifiable
    factors
- Lorazepam (Ativan) 0.5 – 1 mg PO or IV q4h PRN (tablet can be made
    into slurry if patient is experiencing dysphagia)

## Nausea

- Ondansetron (Zofran) 4mg IV q4h or 8mg q8h PRN
- Promethazine (Phenergan) 25mg PO or PR q6h PRN; caution can be very
    sedating
- Prochlorperazine (Compazine) 10mg PO or IV q4h PRN
- Haloperidol (Haldol)
- If felt to be obstructive in etiology, try Dexamethasone 4mg IV or
    SQ q8-12h with Octreotide 100-400mcg IV or SQ q8h
- If felt to be related to anxiety, try Lorazepam; see dosing above
- Scopolamine is highly anti-cholinergic and takes time to be
    effective, so would NOT use in imminently dying patients

## Secretions

- Remember: the patient is NOT bothered by their own secretions, and
    it is often the family and caregivers who are likely disturbed, so
    avoid deep suctioning
- Glycopyrrolate (Robinul) 0.2 – 0.4 mg SQ or IV q6h PRN
- Atropine 1% Ophthalmic Solution 2 drops sublingual 2-4h PRN
