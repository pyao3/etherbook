especially if you have never seen someone do one well before. 
Conversations should follow a logical and sequential approach, much like
any procedure we perform in medicine.  Like all procedures, practice
makes us better.

Good communicators have both **formulated** their message and
**identified** which communication strategy to use before they initiate
a conversation

Here are some suggestions for “Navigating Difficult Conversations”

-   Step 1. Determine your message-keep it simple and short
-   Step 2. Identify what type of news you are communicating: breaking
    bad news, assessing understanding of information, communicating
    prognosis or navigating goals of care
-   Step 3. Pick the video that best suits your purpose
