## Introduction

- The goal of this section is to serve as a guide for tackling the
    most common transplant complications as well as offer a few tips for
    managing immunosuppression while kidney transplant patients are
    admitted to the hospital

## Alphabet soup

- PRA: panel reactive antibodies

- DSA: donor specific antibodies

- CMV (-/+): indicates the CMV status of both the recipient and the
    donor

- FK506 or FK: another name for tacrolimus

- KDPI: Kidney donor profile index used to “grade” the quality of the
    donated organ

- X/6 MM: indicates the number of HLA subtypes that are mismatched
    between donor and recipient

# Infections in Kidney Transplant Recipients

## Background

- Infections in a kidney transplant recipient can be divided into 3
    phases:

  - \<1-month post-transplant

      - Surgical site infections, nosocomial infections (e.g. C. Diff,
          CAUTIs, and CLABSIs), and donor-derived infections/reactivation
          of latent recipient infections predominate

  - 1-6 months post-transplant

      - Depleted immune-system regenerates increased risk for
          disseminated fungal (e.g. PJP, histo/blasto) and viral
          infections (HSV, adenovirus)

  - \>6 months post-transplant

      - Risk for atypical infections persists, but common community
          acquired syndromes should still be on the differential

- This section will focus on the most common infection in kidney
    transplant recipients- infections of the urinary tract

## Evaluation

- UA with culture 

- Examine the native kidneys (CVA tenderness) AND the allograft
    (almost always in RLQ, denervated so the graft itself will not be
    tender, but the surrounding soft-tissue may)

- Renal U/S (of both allograft and native kidneys) or CT AP if:

    - Early post-op (1 month)

    - Recurrent (2+ episodes in year)

    - History of nephrolithiasis or if sepsis/bacteremia

- Blood cultures if systemic signs/symptoms

- Consider testing for C. urealyticum, and sending fungal and AFB
    urine cultures if UA is recurrently positive but culture negative

## Management

- Remove or replace indwelling catheters

- Review prior culture susceptibilities (if available)

- Empiric antibiotic regimens:

    - Asymptomatic bacteriuria: treat with FQ or beta lactam for 5-7 days
        if \<3 mos post-transplant

    - Simple cystitis: Fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin 250 BID or Levaquin
        500 mg daily), Augmentin (500 mg BID), 3rd gen cephalosporin
        (cefpodoxime 100 mg BID or cefixime 400 mg daily) or nitrofurantoin
        100 mg BID (if GFR\>30, only treats cystitis since drug only
        concentrates in the urine)

        - \< 6 mos post-transplant: treat for 10-14 days

        - \>6 mos post-transplant: treat for 5-7 days

    - Complicated UTI/Pyelonephritis (cover Pseudomonas, gram negatives
        and Enterococcus): Ceftriaxone 2g daily (preferred), Cefepime 2g
        q8hrs (add Vancomycin when using cephalosporin if suspicious for
        enterococcus) or Pip-tazo 3.75g q6hrs, can also use meropenem 1g q8h
        (need ID approval)

        - Treat for 14-21 days

        - For stable pts with mild complicated UTI, can consider giving
            more narrow empiric antibiotics: Augmentin 875 mg BID or
            ciprofloxacin 500 mg q12h

    - MDR UTI: Consult transplant ID

        - Options: meropenem-vaborbactam, ceftolozone-tazobactam,
            ceftazidime-avibactam

    - In pts w/PCKD, include lipophilic antibiotic (such as ciprofloxacin)
        to penetrate cysts

## Prevention

- Bactrim used for PJP prophylaxis during first 6 mos post-transplant
    also prevents UTIs

- Basic infection prevention measures for all comers (e.g. hydration,
    frequent voiding, wiping front to back, voiding after sexual
    intercourse)

# Kidney Transplant Immunosuppression

## Background

- Most patients with kidney transplants are on triple therapy with an
    anti-metabolite (azathioprine or mycophenolate compound) or mTOR
    inhibitor + calcineurin inhibitor + prednisone

- You may also come across patients who are on monthly infusions with
    belatacept, a selective T-cell co-stimulation blocker

## Calcineurin inhibitors

- Tacrolimus (FK), cyclosporine (CsA)

- Envarsus XR is a once a day long acting formulation of tacrolimus

    - Common side-effects

        - Worsening kidney function: mediated by vasoconstriction to the
            afferent arterioles

        - Hypertension- treat with CCBs

        - Diabetes

        - Hand tremors, headache, nausea

        - Thrombotic microangiopathy

        - T4 RTA- hyperkalemia

        - Gingival hyperplasia

## mTOR Inhibitors

- Sirolimus, everolimus

    - Major side effects: Poor wound healing, rarely pneumonitis

## Anti-metabolites

- Azathioprine

- Mycophenolate preparations: Mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept, MMF),
    Mycophenolic acid (Myfortic)

- Side effects: Bone marrow suppression- hold for lymphopenia; GI
    upset- hold for diarrhea

## Additional Information for Overnight Admits:

- Do not change immunosuppression

    - Exception: If pt has severe diarrhea, can hold night tacro dose and
    inform the day team

- Daily tacrolimus or cyclosporine level (order qam at 5:00). Always
    order tacrolimus or cyclosporine dose at 6:00 am and 6:00 pm
    (regardless of what time patient takes at home, lab can only run am
    tacro levels at a certain time in batches)

    - EXCEPTION: If late afternoon admission, consider paging the fellow
        (since its early) and ask if they want the evening dose held until
        the am level comes back

- Transplant patients with normal kidney function can have regular
    diet
