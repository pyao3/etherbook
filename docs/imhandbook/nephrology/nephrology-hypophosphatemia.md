# Hypophosphatemia

## Background

- Required for metabolic pathways (ATP production!)

- Most renal reabsorption occurs in proximal tubule via
    sodium-phosphate cotransporter

- Common causes

    - Internal redistribution, reduced intestinal absorption

    - Refeeding syndrome

    - Alkalemia

    - Phos binders on purpose or inadvertently (calcium, aluminum,
        magnesium antacids)

    - Excessive loss (diarrhea, CRRT, increased urinary excretion)

    - Proximal tubular dysfunction such as in Fanconi Syndrome

    - Hyperparathyroidism causes renal phos wasting

    - Post-parathyroidectomy leading to hungry bone syndrome

    - Vitamin D deficiency or resistance

## Presentation

- Mild Hypophosphatemia (serum \>2.0) rarely symptomatic

- PO4-3\< 2.0: Muscle weakness

- PO4-3\< 1.0: Heart failure, respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis,
    seizures

- Failure to wean from ventilator

## Evaluation

- Urine PO4-3 level if cause not readily apparent

- Calculate Fe PO4-3 (\[U PO4-3 x PCr x 100\]/\[P PO4-3x UCr\])

    - Fe PO4-3 \< 5% = normal renal response to hypophos: redistribution
        or ↓ absorption

    - Fe PO4-3 \> 5% = renal phos wasting

## Management

- Caution replacing in pts with impaired renal function: start with
    half suggested dose

- If K+ \> 4 and patient requires IV repletion, may need to use sodium
    PO4-3 in place of K+ PO4-3 IV; po preferred unless severe or
    symptomatic, or patient cannot take po

    - K-Phos neutral: oral, each 250mg tablet has 8 mmol of PO4-3 and
        1.1mEq of K+

    - K+ PO4-3: IV, each mL has 3mmol PO4-3, 4.4 meq K+

    - Na+ PO4-3: IV, each mL has 3mmol PO4-3

- PO4-3\>1.5: PO: 40 – 80 mmol K+Phos neutral (aim for 1 mmol/kg)
    divided into 3-4 doses/day

- PO4-3 1.25 - 1.5: oral 100 mmol K+ PO4-3neutral in 3-4 divided doses
    if asymptomatic

    - IV: 30 mmol K+ PO4-3over 6 hours (aim for 0.4mmol/kg) if symptomatic

- PO4-3\<1.25: IV: 80mmol K+Phos over approximately 12 hours (aim for
    0.5mmol/kg)

    - Check serum PO4-3 2-12 hrs after last dose of PO4-3 to determine if
        additional needs
