# Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT) Basics

## Background/Terminology

- **Dialysis** (diffusive clearance)- solutes diffuse down
    concentration gradients through a semipermeable membrane separating
    blood and dialysate

- **Dialysate** (dialysis bath)- electrolyte solution used to create
    concentration gradient for dialysis. Customizable to treat specific
    electrolyte and acid-base derangements

- **Effluent**- Fluid removed during dialysis or ultrafiltration

- **Ultrafiltration-** Hydrostatic pressure “pushing” water through a
    membrane. There is no dialysate solution used during
    ultrafiltration. Solutes are removed through the process of solvent
    drag. The effluent in this case is isotonic to plasma

- **Total ultrafiltration (UF)** - overall ultrafiltration volume
    produced during treatment

- **UF net** - net ultrafiltrate volume removed from the patient by
    the machine. The overall volume can be completely replaced (net
    even), partially replaced, or not replaced at all. UF net is the
    difference between UF and the volume replaced in the circuit

- **Timing of dialysis**- There are several studies in this space
    (IDEAL, IDEAL-ICU, AKIKI, STARRT, ELAINE). In both the outpatient
    and the inpatient setting, there is no compelling evidence that
    early start dialysis improves mortality compared to later starts

## Outpatient Modalities

- Intermittent hemodialysis (iHD)

- In home hemodialysis

- Peritoneal dialysis

## If someone with ESRD is admitted:

- Urgent ESRD consult if acute need, otherwise can consult them
    routinely

- Routine orders include MWF phos checks and a renal diet

- For peritoneal dialysis pts, their diet can be more liberal and
    include low phos only or even regular diet (Can just ask what diet
    he/she follows at home)

## Acute Setting

- Indications: AKI leading to life-threatening changes in fluid,
    electrolyte, and acid-base balance or toxic ingestion \[AEIOU\]

    - Acidosis: Severe metabolic acidosis (serum pH\<7.1) refractory to correcting volume status or other electrolyte derangements

    - Electrolytes: Severe hyperkalemia \>6.5 despite medical management
        (e.g. loop diuretics, IV fluids, GI cation exchangers, correcting
        acidemia, etc.)

    - Intoxication: Dialyzable toxins and medications

        - Alcohols: ethylene glycol, methanol, isopropyl alcohol,
            diethylene glycol, and propylene glycol

        - Medications: lithium, salicylates, valproic acid, phenytoin,
            barbiturates, carbamazepine, vancomycin, aminoglycosides, etc.

    - Overload: Severe fluid overload (e.g., pulmonary edema) refractory
        to diuretics

    - Uremia: Uremic complications: encephalopathy, pericarditis, platelet
        dysfunction

- Can perform furosemide stress test to help predict who is likely to
    recover their kidney function

    - If Lasix naïve, administer 1mg/kg as a bolus. If on a loop diuretic,
        administer 1.5 mg/kg as a bolus

    - If within the hour they have made 200 cc of urine, then they are
        likely to regain kidney function

- Modalities

    - iHD: Ideal for removal of toxins (e.g. alcohols, dialyzable meds).
        Use with caution in hypotensive patients

    - CRRT: Set a rate of volume removal (typically 0-200 cc/hr) less rapid fluid/electrolytes shifts -> better tolerated in patients with hemodynamic instability
        - Anti-coagulation options- to prevent clotting of circuit
            - None
            - Heparin (preferred). Can be either within the circuit or systemic if indicated for another reason (e.g. DVT/PE).
            - Citrate (need to monitor calcium frequently)
        - Complications of CRRT: Infections, hypophosphatemia

- Access

    - Dialysis catheter (aka: Vascath)

        - Non-tunneled catheter (Trialysis) used for acute dialysis

        - Different lengths depending on site (see procedures section)

    - Tunneled dialysis catheter (ex: Permcath)

        - Typically used as a bridge to fistula/graft placement

        - Placed by IR

# Peritoneal Dialysis Peritonitis

## Background

- Typically occurs due to contamination with pathogenic skin bacteria
    during exchanges or due to exit-site/tunnel infection

- Usually presents with cloudy effluent fluid and abdominal pain. Can
    also be asymptomatic

- Important history to obtain: recent contamination, accidental
    disconnection, endoscopic or gynecologic procedure, as well as the
    presence of constipation or diarrhea

- Definitive diagnosis requires 2 of the following:

    - Clinical features consistent with peritonitis

    - Positive dialysis effluent culture

    - Dialysis effluent with WBC \> 100 with PMN \> 50%

        - Even if WBC count \< 100, presence of \> 50% PMNs is still
            strong evidence of peritonitis in pts with rapid cycle PD

## Evaluation

- Examine catheter exit site

- Culture peritoneal fluid (requires specific technique, done by
    nephrology)

- Peritoneal cell count with diff, gram stain and culture

- Obtain peripheral blood cultures if there is concern for sepsis

## Management

- All PD orders, intraperitoneal antibiotics, and prescription
    adjustments should be directed by ESRD consult service (page them
    overnight if concerns)

- Treatment with intraperitoneal antibiotics should be started
    immediately after specimens have been obtained if there is high
    clinical suspicion

- Empiric antibiotics regimen should cover both gram-positive and
    gram-negative organisms, typically with vancomycin and third
    generation Cephalosporin

- Systemic antibiotics are generally not necessary unless pts have
    systemic signs of sepsis

- Pts with relapsing, recurrent or repeat peritonitis will likely need
    catheter removal

## Secondary prevention

- Treatment with intraperitoneal OR IV antibiotics (for any infection
    requiring \> 1 dose of antibiotics) requires prophylaxis for fungal
    peritonitis with either:

    - Nystatin 400,000 to 500,000 units orally TID

    - Fluconazole 200 mg every other day or 100 mg qdaily

- Dialysate should be drained the day of endoscopies or gynecological
    procedures
