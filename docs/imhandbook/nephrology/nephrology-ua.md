# Approach to Urinalysis 

Laura Binari, Patrick Steadman

## Background

- 3 components: Gross Evaluation, Dipstick Analysis, Microscopic Exam

- Indications: dysuria, gross hematuria, fever + GU symptoms, AKI,
    volume overload

- If Foley, obtain sample from catheter, not the urine bag

- Spinning Urine

    - At VUMC, take sample to lab on 4th floor to centrifuge the sample at
        1500 rpm for 5 minutes, remove supernatant and then resuspend
        sediment, place drops of urine on the slide, examine with microscope

    - At the VA, there is a microscopy room where you can spin urine as
        well

    - Ideally, the specimen should be a fresh catch (\<2-4 hours old);
        Beware: casts like to migrate to the edges of the coverslip!

## Gross Evaluation

- Turbid: Infection, precipitated crystals, or chyluria

- Color: Red Urine (broad DDx, see Hematuria section, includes certain
    meds such as rifampin/phenytoin), White (polyuria, phosphate
    crystals), Green (methylene blue), Pink (uric acid crystals,
    post-propofol infusion), Black (hemoglobinuria/myoglobinuria)

## Dipstick Analysis

- Quality of sample: should have zero squamous epithelial cells

    - Specific gravity: normal = 1.010

    - Surrogate for urine osmolality & hydration: can have falsely high
        specific gravity if large particles (contrast, glucose) present

    - Trick: Last 2 digits of S.G. x 30 = Uosm. For example: S.G. is
        1.013; 13 x 30 = 390 mOsm/L

- Urinary pH: normal pH is 5.5-6.5

    - Alkaline pH: bicarb suppl, vegan diet, urease producing organisms
        (staghorn calculi)

    - Acidic pH: uric acid stones, appropriate response to acidemia

- Proteinuria: dipstick detects albumin ONLY (not paraproteins)

    - Mild albuminuria (30-300 mg/day) not detected by standard dipsticks

    - F/u with spot protein to Cr ratio or 24 hr urine collection
        (nephrotic range \>3.5 g/day)

    - Transient: due to volume depletion, CHF, fever, postural,
        exercise-induced

    - Ddx: primary glomerular dx, secondary glomerular dx (DM, amyloid,
        infxn, sickle cell, etc.) vs tubular vs overflow (multiple myeloma)

- Heme (see hematuria section): False(+) if semen, false(-) w/
    ascorbic acid

- WBC:

    - False(+) 2/2 contamination with squamous cells. If bacteria -\>
        consider UTI/pyelo w/hematuria -\> inflammation; May have sterile
        pyuria

    - Ddx includes chlamydia, ureaplasma, TB, malignancy, viral infxn,
        kidney stones, GN, urethritis, steroid, cyclophosphamide use

- Ketones:

    - Never normal in urine; only detects acetic acid

    - Ddx: DKA, starvation ketoacidosis, pregnancy, keto diet

- Glucose: max threshold at proximal tubule exceeded (\~serum glucose
    180 mg/dL)

    - DM, Cushingâ€™s, liver/pancreatic dx, SGLT2i use; or a primary defect
        of proximal reabsorption (w/phosphaturia, uricosuria, amino aciduria
        think Fanconi syndrome)

- Leukocyte esterase: enzyme released by lysed neutrophils,
    macrophages

    - Associated with pyuria and infections; false(-) from hematuria or
        glucosuria


- Nitrites: reduction of urinary nitrates by nitrate reductase

    - Certain bacteria (e.g. Enterobacteriaceae) express, others (e.g.
        Enterococci) do not

- Bilirubin: conjugated = water soluble (passes through glomerulus),
    unlike unconjugated

    - Liver dysfunction and biliary obstruction

- Urobilinogen: end product of conjugated bilirubin, normally
    \~1.0mg/dL is normal

    - Can be elevated due to hepatocellular dx or hemolysis

## Microscopic Examination of the Urine Sediment

- Cells:

    - Dysmorphic RBCs (sign of GN), squamous epithelial cells
        (contamination), tubular cells (abnormal, indicates renal dx),
        neutrophils (UTI, AIN, TB, sterile pyuria), eosinophils (think AIN,
        not sensitive thus cannot exclude diagnosis)


- Casts:

    - Hyaline (pyelo; CKD, normal subjects), RBC (GN), WBC (GN, pyelo,
        interstitial dx, inflammation), epithelial - renal tubular cells
        (ATN, interstitial nephritis, nephritic sx, heavy metal ingestion),
        granular or waxy (presence of kidney disease, but nonspecific),
        muddy brown casts (ATN); fatty (nephrotic syndrome)

- Crystals:

    - Ca++ oxalate (envelope/dumbbell shape), uric acid (rhombic/rosette
        shaped, classically formed in acidic urine), cystine (hexagonal,
        found in cystinuria), Mg ++ ammonium phosphate (aka struvite stones,
        from increased ammonia production, in setting of urease producing
        bacteria such as Proteus or Klebsiella UTIs)

    - Calcium oxalate crystals + AKI, consider ethylene glycol
        intoxication

    - Uric Acid crystals + AKI, consider tumor lysis syndrome
