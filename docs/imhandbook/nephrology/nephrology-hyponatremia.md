# Hyponatremia

## Background

- Definition:

    - Mild: Na+ 130-134

    - Moderate: Na+ 125-129

    - Severe: Na+ \<125

- Hyponatremia occurs when free water reabsorption (i.e. ADH is on) or
    intake exceeds free water excretion

## Presentation

- Mild to moderate symptoms: lethargy, N/V, dizziness, confusion,
    fatigue, cramping

- Severe symptoms: obtundation, coma, respiratory arrest, seizure

## Evaluation and Management

- Step 1: Serum osm 

    - \>295: Hyper-osmolar, presence of other molecules that contribute to
        serum osmolarity 

        - Glucose, mannitol, iodinated contrast

        - If hyperglycemic, corrected serum Na+ = measured Na+ +
            1.6\*\[(glucose – 100)/100\]  

            - If corrected Na+ is normal, treat hyperglycemia; not a water
                balance problem 

            - If corrected Na+ is low, there is hypotonic hyponatremia +
                coexisting hyperglycemia 

        - Renal failure (urea) and ethanol: Ineffective osmoles that can
            freely diffuse across cells and do NOT lead to hyponatremia

    - 275-295: Iso-osmolar 

        - Pseudohyponatremia 2/2 hypertriglyceridemia, paraproteinemia, or
            lipoprotein X: Serum Na not actually low, due to how the lab is
            calculated 

    - \<275: Hypo-osmolar à Step 2 

- Step 2: Urine Osm

    - Surrogate for ADH activity

    - Uosm \<100 or Uosm \< Sosm correlates with low ADH

        - Primary polydipsia: Free water intake\>output  

        - Tea and toast: Lack solute to effectively concentrate urine 

        - Beer drinkers’ potomania: Mixture of the two above

    - Uosm \>100 or Uosm \> Sosm correlates with high ADH Step 3 

- Step 3: Urine Na

    - Is ADH on in the setting of decreased effective arterial bloodvolume
        (EABV) or decreased mean arterial pressure (i.e. appropriate ADH)?

    - UNa \<20: Low EABV à RAAS upregulation w/ Na avidity-\> appropriate
        ADH release

        - If true volume depletion, then trial 500cc-1L NS bolus and
            monitor serum Na. IVF bolus-\>Increase EABV à ↓ ADH release à ↑
            free water excretion

        - If edematous state (e.g. heart failure or cirrhosis), then
            decongestion with diuretics may improve serum Na

    - UNa \>40: Euvolemic with no stimulus for ADH-\> SIADH

        - SIADH from: n/v, malignancy, meds, surgery, pulmonary disease,
            hormones, pain, bladder distension: ↑ ADH out of proportion to
            stimulus  

            - Treat with water restriction. Can add NaCl or urea tabs if
                fluid restriction is severe 

            - Water restriction (L/day) = 600 / uosm (600 mEq Na in
                American diet/day)

            - Salt wasting: diuretics, cerebral salt wasting (aka
                hypovolemic SIADH), SSRIs

            - Other: Hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency 

- If still stumped, can check a FeNa and measure a serum uric acid

    - FeNa \<0.5 % suggests appropriate ADH activity.

    - High uric acid suggests some degree of volume depletion and
        appropriate ADH activity.

## Rate of correction

- Acute (\<48 hrs)

    - If symptomatic, give 150 cc bolus 3% NaCl up to two times.

    - Monitor Na+ q1-2 hr

    - Goal is an initial rapid 4-6 mEq/L correction and then hold

        - May require Hypertonic Saline infusion with DDAVP clamp if at
            risk of over-correcting

- Chronic (\>48 hrs or unknown, higher risk for osmotic demyelination
    if corrected too quickly):

    - Goal Na+ correction rate 4-6 mEq/L over 24 hrs (Max 8mEq/L)

## When to call Nephrology

- If you are worried about rapid over-correction:

    - High risk patients are those with rapidly reversible causes

        - Low solute states (Beer drinker’s potomania, psychogenic
            polydipsia, tea-toast)- as soon as they decrease their excess
            free water intake, they will rapidly clear free water

        - Volume depletion- as volume is replaced and the stimulus for ADH
            release is switched off, then they will rapidly clear the excess
            free water if they have normal underlying kidney function

    - High risk for ODS includes: chronic liver disease, Na \<105 meq/dL,
        alcoholism, and malnutrition.

- Consideration of DDAVP clamp
