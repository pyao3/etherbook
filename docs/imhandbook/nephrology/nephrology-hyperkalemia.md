# Hyperkalemia 

Mengyao Tang and Amanda Morrison

## Background

- Causes:

    - Cellular shifts: Acidemia, Rhabdomyolysis, TLS, beta blockade

    - Aldosterone deficient states: T4 RTA, Primary adrenal insufficiency

    - Decreased distal tubular delivery: Volume depletion

    - Decreased clearance: AKI, CKD, ESRD

    - Excessive intake

    - Medication-related: ACEi, ARB, MRA, NSAIDs, TMP/SMX, digoxin,
        heparin

- Pseudo-Hyperkalemia: hemolysis, severe leukocytosis

- Symptoms are rare, but usually manifest as cardiac dysrhythmias

## Evaluation

- Confirm hyperkalemia with repeat BMP

- Check EKG for hyperkalemic changes (sensitivity for EKG findings in
    hyper K is poor)

    - K+ 5.5-6.5: peaked T waves, prolonged PR interval

    - K+ 6.5-8: prolonged QRS, loss of P wave, ST elevation, ectopic beats

    - K+ \>8: sine wave pattern, asystole, PEA, VF

## Management

- If EKG changes or signs of instability

    - Calcium gluconate 1g IV (effective within 3-5 min)

        - Stabilizes cardiac membrane for \~60mins

        - SHOULD BE REPEATED HOURLY while hyperkalemic

- Shift K+ (temporizing measures)

    - D50 w/ regular insulin 10 units (can order using Adult Hyperkalemia
        order set in epic)

        - Use 5 units if there is renal impairment

        - Lasts for 4-6hrs (can be longer in renal impairment)

- Correct acidosis- Consider using isotonic bicarb

- Beta Agonists (e.g. high-dose albuterol nebulizer); lasts 2-4 hrs

    - Note that typical albuterol nebulizer is 2.5mg, need 10-20mg to
        have an effect

- Increase K+ Excretion


    - Loop diuretic- if the kidneys work, use them

        - If there is AKI or a volume deficit can administer with IVF

    - Volume expansion with IVF: Increases distal Na delivery and K
        excretion. NS and LR are likely equally effective.

    - GI cation exchangers

        - Kayexalate (Polystyrene sulfonate)- only effective if having
            BMs. 60g PO q2h until bowel movement (If using oral, ensure
            patient is having bowel movements and is not obstructed, could
            cause bowel injury/ necrosis). PO can take up to 6hrs to work.
            Consider per rectal administration for faster action but DO NOT
            GIVE WITH SORBITOL per rectum

        - Lokelma (Sodium-zirconium-cyclosilicate) 10 g PO TID for 48 H.
            Actively exchanges K for other cations within the small bowel
            and works within 2 hours. Remember to stop once the K is normal
            since can cause hypokalemia. Also keep in mind the high Na
            content of Lokelma (400mg/5g dose of lokelma)

            - Needs approval from Nephrology

- Hemodialysis: Consult nephrology early if severe hyper K+
