## Overview of dysnatremias

- Fluctuations in serum Na reflect fluctuations in plasma free water

- Sodium is the major driver of tonicity. The clinical signs and
    symptoms of serum Na fluctuations are related to changes in tonicity
    with most profound effects on cerebral tissue

- Two major mechanisms maintain plasma osmolarity between 275 and 290:
    Thirst and secretion of ADH. When these mechanisms malfunction,
    dysnatremias occur

## Background

- Definition: Na+ \>145

- Hypernatremia = decreased free water

- Almost always due to inadequate free water intake (ICU patients,
    dementia, limited mobility, tube feeding/TPN, impaired
    thirst/adipsia from hypothalamic stroke). Hospital acquired
    hypernatremia is iatrogenic and correlates with poor outcomes

- Can also occur from: Na+ overload (salt poisoning, iatrogenic from
    NS infusion, over correction), osmotic diuresis (hyperglycemia,
    SGLT-2 inhibitors, urea, mannitol), diabetes insipidus

## Presentation

- Lethargy, irritability, confusion

- Seizures, coma, hemorrhagic stroke, or subarachnoid hemorrhage (from
    the effects of hypertonic serum on cerebral vasculature)

## Evaluation

- Step 1: Treat underlying cause (vomiting, hyperglycemia,
    medications)

- Step 2: Determine volume status: If severely hypovolemic, the
    patient will need IV crystalloid to restore volume in addition to
    free water

- Step 3: Estimate and replace free water deficit (FWD):

    - FWD = TBW x \[(serum Na/140) - 1\]

- Step 4: Account for ongoing insensible losses and electrolyte free
    water clearance

    - Rule of thumb for accounting for electrolyte free water clearance. *This is in addition to replacing free water deficit*

        - 0-1 Liter of urine output: Ignore, no need to replace

        - 1-3 Liters of urine output: Replace half of the losses

        - \>3 liters of urine output: Replace all urine losses

- No evidence that overcorrecting hypernatremia is harmful. In fact,
    there is increased mortality with overly cautious correction or
    under correction

- If able, replace free water enterally. Otherwise, administer D5W
    intravenously

## Additional Information

- Pts w/ suspected DI: Consult Nephrology (may require desmopressin or
    may receive desmopressin once stabilized to differentiate between
    central and nephrogenic DI)

- Pts with hypokalemia: giving K decreases total amount of free water
    you are giving the pt
