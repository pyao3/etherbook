# Approach to Chronic Kidney Disease 

Terra Swanson

---

## Definition of CKD

- Decreased kidney function or one or more markers of kidney damage
    for 3 or more months

- History of kidney transplant

- GFR \< 60; Staging helps risk-stratify pts likely to progress or
    develop complications of CKD
    - CKD IIIa: eGFR 45-60
    - CKD IIIb: eGFR 30-44
    - CKD IV: eGFR 15-30
    - CKD V: eGFR \< 15

- Markers of kidney damage

    - Albumin/Cr ratio

        - Mild: 0-30 mg/g

        - Moderate: 30-300 mg/g

        - Severe: \>300 mg/g

- Urine sediment: RBC casts, WBC casts, oval fat bodies or fatty
    casts, granular casts

- Electrolyte derangements

- Abnormalities on histology

- Structural abnormalities: (cysts, hydronephrosis, scarring, masses,
    renal artery stenosis)

## When to refer to nephrology clinic

- eGFR \< 45

- Persistent urine albumin/creatinine ratio \> 300 mg/g

- Urine protein/creatinine ratio greater than 500 mg/g

- Rapid loss of kidney function (\> 30% decline over 4 months)

- Hematuria not 2/2 urologic condition or if there are RBC casts on UA

- Inability to identify presumed cause of renal dysfunction

- Difficult to manage complications (hyperkalemia, anemia,
    bone-mineral disease, HTN)

- Confirmed or presumed hereditary kidney disease (PCKD suspected)

## Complications of CKD

- Imbalance of water homeostasis
    - As renal mass declines the ability to both concentrate and dilute the urine is impaired
    - This manifests as hyponatremia (no end-organ to respond to ADH) and edema
    - Treat this with water restriction, diuretics or, eventually, ultrafiltration

## Metabolic acidosis

- Correcting serum bicarbonate to a goal of 23-30 meq/L slows decline
    in renal function and protects against bone-mineral complications of
    chronic metabolic acidosis

- Can calculate bicarbonate deficit to estimate dose of bicarbonate

- If bicarb \< 22, consider:

    - Sodium bicarb 650 mg TID (8mEq bicarb per 650mg tablet) up to 5850mg/day (70 mEq or 3 tabs TID)
    - Sodium citrate (Bicitra): 1mL = 1 mEq \* Careful in cirrhosis since citrate cannot be metabolized
    - Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate): 1 teaspoon = 59 mEq HCO3 (careful of Na load)

## HTN in CKD

- Goal BP \< 120/80 (Class 2B recommendation) based on SPRINT trial,
    ACC/AHA 2017, and KDIGO 2021 guidelines

- All comers: Diet (e.g. DASH) and lifestyle modifications

- CKD without albuminuria or DM:
    - Start pharmacotherapy based on ASCVD risk as well as risk for other target organ damage

- CKD with moderate to severe albuminuria w/ or w/out DM
    - ACEi or ARB titrated to maximally tolerated dose (Class 1B recommendation)
    - Thiazide-like diuretics (see CLICK trial for chlorthalidone in
    advanced CKD)
    - Loop diuretics can assist with volume driven HTN in patients with CKD 4-5

- HTN in kidney transplant
    - CCBs or ARBs are first line (Class 1C recommendation)

- Consider stopping ACE-i/ARB if:
    - GFR declines \>30% over 4 months. Consider evaluation for renal artery stenosis
    - K \> 5.5 despite low K diet, optimizing dose of diuretics, or adding K-binders

## Anemia in CKD

- Multifactorial: decreased EPO production, impaired iron absorption,
    uremic toxins suppressing bone marrow, loss of blood in dialysis
    circuit, and from GI AVMs

- Indications for iron supplementation in non-dialysis patients:
    - ALL patients with TSAT \<20% and ferritin \<100 ng/mL
    - Patients with Hb \<13 and TSAT \<30% and ferritin \<500 ng/mL
    - Can start with PO supplementation (see Anemia section). Reassess iron levels in 1-3 mos; if not appropriately ↑, consider IV iron repletion

- Dialysis patients:
    - IV Iron preferred method of repletion for HD patients with
        - TSAT \< 20% and ferritin \< 200
        - TSAT \<30% and ferritin \<500 AND with Hb \< 10 OR are on EPO

- Dosing: usually administered at HD sessions
        - 125 mg ferric gluconate at consecutive HD sessions x 8 doses
        - 100 mg iron sucrose at consecutive HD sessions x 10 doses
        - Ferumoxytol 510mg at the end of two HD sessions 1-4 weeks apart

- Indications for EPO

    - Pts w/ Hb \<10 who are not iron deficient (ferritin \>500) or
        who’s anemia persists despite adequate iron repletion

## Hyperkalemia (Goal K \< 5.5)

- Patients with diabetic nephropathy (T4 RTA) and CKD 5-ESRD are at
    the highest risk

- Strategies to mitigate hyperK

    - Low K diet (\< 40-70 mEq/day or 1500-2700 mg/day)

    - Loop diuretics

    - GI cation exchangers

        - Patiromer (Veltassa): binds K in colon in exchange for calcium

        - Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (Lokelma): binds K throughout intestine in exchange for sodium and H+

        - Do not use Kayexelate as chronic therapy

- Treat metabolic acidosis

## Mineral bone disease in ESRD

- Avoid calcium supplementation in mild or asymptomatic hypocalcemia

- Replace vitamin D to \>20 (weak evidence)

- Phos goal \< 5.5

    - Sevelamer: use lowest dose effective to achieve Phos \< 5.5

        - Phos 5.5-7.5: initial dose 800 TID with meals

        - Phos 7.5-9.0: initial dose 1200-1600 TID with meals

        - Phos \> 9: initial dose 1600 TID

        - Can titrate dosing by 400 to 800 mg per meal at 2-week intervals

    - Restrict dietary phos to 900 mg/day

- PTH goal in CKD3: 2x ULN

- PTH Goal in ESRD: 2-10x ULN

## Diabetes in CKD

- Individualize A1C goals. Both the ADA and VA-DOD have guidelines for
    selecting A1C targets

- Treatment:
    - Metformin remains first-line but should be dose-reduced based on
    eGFR

        - eGFR \> 45: Maximum daily dose of 2000mg/day (1000mg bid)

        - eGFR \< 45: Reduce max daily dose to 1000mg/day (500mg bid)

        - eGFR \< 30: Discontinue if high risk for volume mediated
        AKI/chronically ill

    - SGLT-2 inhibitors for patients with eGFR \> 30 reduces progression to ESRD and death from renal or cardiovascular cause (Evidence: DAPA-CKD, CREEDENCE)

    - Finerenone (non-steroidal MRA)- would ask nephrology for help if considering this option since relatively new and increased risk for hyperkalemia. (Evidence: FIDELIO)

## Dialysis initiation

- Early (CKD3a or 3b) referral to nephrology has better outcomes

- Uremic symptoms: fatigue, sleep disturbance, N/V, decreased
    appetite, dysgeusia, itching, hiccupping

- Refractory hyper K

- Refractory hypertension

- Plot your patient’s eGFR using the graph function in EPIC or CPRS to
    determine trajectory (normal age-related decline after age 60 is \~
    1ml/min/m2)
