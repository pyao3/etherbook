# Acute Kidney Injury of Kidney Transplant

## Background

- Most patients admitted to medicine services with kidney transplants
    are \>3 months post-op. Therefore, we are typically not managing
    perioperative complications such as delayed graft function, or
    hyper-acute rejection. Below are the most common causes of acute
    kidney injury in kidney transplant recipients.

## Evaluation

- Signs and symptoms of UTI?

- Assess volume status

- Review meds for recent medication changes

    - Common offenders: NSAIDs, ACE, diuretics, azole antifungals

    - Medication non-adherence

- Tacrolimus (FK) or cyclosporine (CsA) level

    - FK levels increase with n/v, diarrhea due to alterations in
        p-glycoprotein expression within inflamed GI tract

    - FK toxicity also causes diarrhea and volume depletion

- Proteinuria:

    - Transplant patients with 1 g/day proteinuria usually get biopsies


- Review donor characteristics (CMV status, PRA, % HLA antibodies
    present, DSAs)

- BK PCR: consider only if unclear source of AKI and no recent titers

    - Serum PCR is test of choice

- Renal transplant U/S (costly and not always warranted)

    - \< 1 week post-transplant: If acute graft dysfunction, look for
        thrombosis, urine/ureter leak

    - \> 1 week post-transplant:

        - Cr does not respond to 48 hours of current management

        - Lack of clear, reversible causes

        - Hydronephrosis (can occur after stent removal 4-6 wks after
            transplant or due to perinephric fluid collection)

        - Arterial stenosis (â†‘ velocities in renal artery -- very
            concerning when velocity \>300), tardus parvus waveforms)

        - Perinephric abscess with recurrent UTI/pyelonephritis

        - Urinoma (usually first 2-3 weeks), hematoma (after a biopsy)

    - Unique findings:

        - Resistive indices: reflect central renal vascular compliance.
            High indices in transplant patients signify parenchymal problem
            (rejection, infection, ATN)

- Biopsy

    - To differentiate ATN vs rejection vs BK nephropathy vs recurrent
            disease (FSGS, lupus, etc.)

    - Post Biopsy Care:

        - Watch for bleeding and HTN

        - Blood can get into collecting system, then the capsule, and into
            the perinephric space causing Page Kidney (aka Pressure
            Tamponade)

        - Compressed renal vessels-\> RAAS surge --\> rapid, severe
            HTN (STAT page the renal fellow)
