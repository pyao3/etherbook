# Hypocalcemia 

Trey Richardson

---

## Background

- Can be divided into low parathyroid hormone and high parathyroid
    hormone states

  - Low PTH

      - Magnesium deficiency

      - Post-operative for parathyroidectomy

      - DiGeorge syndrome

      - Medications: Bisphosphonates, denosumab, aminoglycosides,
          gadolinium

      - Acidemia (Serum Ca is inversely proportional to pH)

      - Infiltrative disease: sarcoid, hemochromatosis, malignancies

      - Autoimmune hypoparathyroidism

      - CRRT (if using regional citrate anticoagulation)

  - High PTH

      - Late-stage CKD

      - Hyperphosphatemia

      - Vitamin D deficiency

      - Pseudohypoparathyroidism/Parathyroid resistance

      - Consumption/deposition: Pancreatitis, rhabdomyolysis, some
          osteoblastic metastases

      - Sepsis or critical illness

## Presentation

- Chvostek and Trousseauâ€™s signs, laryngospasm, seizures, widened QRS
    and arrhythmias

- Hemodynamic instability

## Evaluation

- Check PTH, albumin, iCal, VBG, Vitamin D

- Review medications for possible offenders

## Management

- Under most circumstances there is no need to replace calcium.
    Instead, focus on correcting the underlying perturbation (e.g.
    acidemia, hypomagnesemia, treating pancreatitis, etc. )

- If hemodynamic instability, cardiac electrical instability, seizures
    then aggressive intravenous replacement is warranted.

    - Also consider preemptive repletion for patients requiring
        high-volume of blood transfusions (citrate in blood products can
        cause hypocalcemia)

    - 1 g of CaCl is equivalent to 3 grams of Ca Gluconate

- Avoid treatment in hyperphosphatemia, advanced CKD/ESRD, and rhabdomyolysis
