# Hypomagnesemia

Mike Tozier

---

## Background

- Definition: Mg2+ \< 1.8 mg/dL, most pts asymptomatic until \<1.2
    mg/dL. Severe \[Mg+2\] \< 1 mg/dL

- Causes:

    - GI losses: Diarrhea, malabsorption, acute pancreatitis, EtOH use,
        TPN, vomiting, NG suction, GI fistulas, anorexia, short gut
        syndrome, small bowel bypass

    - Drugs: PPIs, loop diuretics, thiazides, digoxin, amphotericin,
        aminoglycosides, foscarnet, cisplatin, calcineurin inhibitors,
        laxatives, pentamidine

    - Kidney losses: post-ATN diuresis, Bartter syndrome and Gitelman
        syndrome

    - Cellular shifts: DKA treatment/recovery, refeeding, hungry bone
        syndrome, correction of metabolic acidosis, pancreatitis, EtOH
        withdrawal

    - Other: DM, hyper Ca, hyperthyroid, hyperaldosteronism, burns,
        lactation, Vit D deficiency, heat, prolonged exercise, mitral valve
        prolapse, pseudohypomagnesemia 2/2 EDTA tube, lactation

## Presentation

- Refractory hypocalcemia or hypokalemia, arrhythmias, muscle weakness

- Severe symptoms: seizures, drowsiness, confusion, coma, arrhythmias

- Vertical nystagmus, tetany (Chvostek sign, Trousseau), tremors,
    fasciculations

## Evaluation

- EKG: Initially wide QRS, peaked Ts. Progresses to wide PR,
    diminished T, arrhythmias

- Labs: Ca+2, K+, can use FEMg (order urine Mg+2 and Cr, serum Cr and
    Mg) or 24-hour urine for Mg to distinguish renal vs GI etiology
    (FEMg\>2% renal, \<2% GI)

## Management

- Correct underlying cause, replete based on severity (Dosing below
    for normal GFR)

- Oral: asymptomatic pts, can cause GI symptoms, not well absorbed

    - Sustained release (Mg Chloride or Mg L-lactate) better tolerated and
        absorbed, though standard preparations (Mg oxide) are faster acting

    - Mg chloride: 3-4 tabs BID (total 30 to 56 meq \[15 to 28 mmol\]) for
        severe hypo Mg

    - 2-4 tabs daily (total 10 to 28 meq \[5 to 14 mmol\]) for mild hypo
        Mg

    - Mg oxide: 400-800 mg BID (20 to 40 mmol \[40 to 80 meq\]) for
        mod-severe hypo Mg

- Intravenous: for symptomatic patients or if GI intolerance to oral

    - Mg \<1 mg/dL: 4 to 8g of MgSO4 (32 to 64 meq \[16 to 32 mmol\]) over
        12 to 24 hrs

    - Mg 1 to 1.5 mg/dL: 4 g MgSO4 (16 to 32 meq \[8 to 16 mmol\]) over 4
        to 12 hrs

    - Mg 1.6 to 1.9 give 1 to 2 grams MgSO4 (8 to 16 meq \[4 to 8 mmol\])
        1-2 hrs

        - VUMC only has 4g bags of IV mag so would need to ask nurses to
            only infuse 1/2 bag

    - Infusion rate should not exceed 2 g/hr to minimize urinary excretion

## Additional Information

- Renal impairment: replete with caution, reduce dose by 50-75% and
    monitor closely

- If persistent hypo Mg in pts requiring diuresis, try K-sparing
    diuretic (e.g. Amiloride)

- Treat concomitant hypokalemia, hypocalcemia or hypophosphatemia

- In pts with concomitant hypophos and hypocalcemia, IV Mg alone -\>
    worse hypophos
