# Hyperphosphatemia 

Peter Thorne and Amanda Morrison

---

## Background

- Phosphate (PO4-3) \>4.5mg/dL

- Etiologies:

    - Cellular shifts: Cellular lysis (TLS, Rhabdomyolysis), Acidemia

    - Increased intake/absorption or iatrogenic hyperphosphatemia (Over
        repletion, Vitamin D toxicity, use of Fleet’s enemas, etc.)

    - Decreased phosphate clearance (Acute or chronic renal disease,
        hypoparathyroidism, pseudohypoparathyroidism)

## Presentation

- Symptoms are usually secondary to coexistent hypocalcemia
    (psychosis, seizure, perioral paresthesia’s, muscle weakness)

- Can cause acute phosphate nephropathy with phosphate containing
    laxatives

- Calciphylaxis if concurrent hypercalcemia (high Ca+2 x PO4-3product)

## Evaluation

- Labs: BMP (calcium, creatinine), VBG, Vit D, PTH, PTHrP, lactate

## Management

- Acute

    - If renal function normal, can often treat with IVF (promote PO4-3
        excretion)

    - Consider need for calcium supplementation (see hypocalcemia section)

    - If renal function impaired and severe hypocalcemia present =
        consider hemodialysis


- Chronic

    - Usually secondary to chronic renal failure, goal PO4-3 3.5-5.5 in
        CKD patients

    - Renal diet (low PO4-3)

    - PO4-3 binders: Ca+2 containing (calcium carbonate and calcium
        acetate) and non Ca+2 containing (sevelamer, lanthanum, and iron
        based such as ferric citrate)

        - Sevelamer is significantly more expensive than calcium
            containing binders

            - Given 3 times daily with meals, started at 800mg (Can be ↑
                to 1,600mg TID)

            - Should not be given if pt is not eating

        - Calcium acetate: started at 1334mg TID with meals

    - Limit dose changes to chronic binders upon discharge

    - Need to avoid calcium containing binders in patients with
        calciphylaxis
