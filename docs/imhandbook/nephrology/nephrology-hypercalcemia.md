# Hypercalcemia 

Rebecca Choudhry and Trevor Stevens

## Background

- Total serum Calcium \>10.5

- Most (99%) Ca+2 is anhydrous and stored in bone. The remaining 1% is
    60% bound (mostly to albumin), and 40% ionized and able to exert a
    physiologic effect

- Remember, there is an inverse relationship between pH and Ca2+. As
    pH declines, serum Ca increases due to H+ binding to albumin and
    releasing Ca2+

- Don’t forget to correct calcium level if hypoalbuminemia (or check
    ionized calcium level),

    - Corrected Ca2+ = ((Normal albumin – Patient’s albumin) x 0.8)) +
        Patient’s Ca2+

        - This equation Is less reliable at very low albumin

## Presentation

- Ca+2 \> 12 can cause shortened QT interval, 2nd and 3rd degree heart
    block, ventricular arrhythmias, and ST elevations mimicking MI

- Severe manifestations uncommon at Ca+2 \<14

- “Stones, bones, thrones, belly groans, and psychiatric overtones”

    - Bone pain

    - Polydipsia/polyuria- due to nephrogenic DI

    - Nausea/constipation

    - Depressed mood/cognitive impairment

    - Decreased level of consciousness

## Evaluation

- Measure PTH

    - Normal or ↑ PTH

        - Primary hyperparathyroidism: ↑ Ca+2 and ↓ PO4-3

        - Tertiary hyperparathyroidism (autologous secretion of PTH in
            CKD/ESRD)

        - Familial hypercalciuric hypercalcemia (often asymptomatic, no
            treatment required).

        - Li toxicity

    - ↓ PTH

        - Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (PTHrP)

        - Malignancy (boney metastases)

        - Excess vitamin D intake

        - Granulomatous disease: 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D, 25
            hydroxyvitamin D, or ACE level

        - Milk-alkali syndrome

        - Medications (classically HCTZ)

        - Thyrotoxicosis

        - Adrenal insufficiency

## Management

- If Ca+2 \< 12 and asymptomatic

    - Encourage PO hydration

    - Normal saline if hypovolemic

    - Evaluate for underlying cause


- If Ca+2 \> 12 with symptoms or Ca \> 14

    - Trend Ca q8 hrs, EKG, monitor on telemetry; strict I/Os +/- foley
        catheter

    - Volume expansion w/ NS bolus followed by continuous infusion at \~
        200cc/hr

        - Goal UOP 100-150cc/hr

    - Add loop diuretic (Lasix) once patient is volume expanded

    - Bisphosphonates

        - Zoledronic acid 4mg IV (EGFR \>60), Pamidronate 90mg IV (EGFR
            15-60)

- If Ca+2 \>14 or neurologic symptoms, consider subq (not intranasal)
    calcitonin

    - VUMC: requires approval from an oncology or endocrine attending

    - Tachyphylaxis after \~48H

- Additional Information

    - In CHF pt, consider early addition of a loop diuretic, especially if
        volume overloaded

    - In ESRD pt with hypercalcemia (rare), patient with oliguric AKI not
        responsive to IVF, or pt with severely elevated Ca 16-18, consult
        endocrine and nephrology early

    - In pts with sarcoidosis or lymphoma, consider glucocorticoids
