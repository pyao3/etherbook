# Background

- Abnormal serum H+ concentrations lead to impaired cellular function
    (cardiac arrest, vasodilation, decreased response to
    catecholamines), electrolyte abnormalities (e.g. hypo- and
    hyperkalemia, hypo- and hypercalcemia), impaired glucose metabolism,
    impaired drug metabolism, and a whole host of other complications
    that translate to increased morbidity and mortality

- ABG/VBG reference ranges:
    - pH = 7.36-7.44 (\~7.32-7.40)

    - PCO2 = 36-44 mmHg

    - pO2: 60-100 mmHg

    - HCO3 = 22-26 mEq/L

- Useful formulas

    - pH on ABG = VBG pH + 0.035

    - Anion Gap= Na-(Cl+Bicarb)

    - Normal Anion Gap= 12-14

    - Calculated Osmolarity= 2\[Na\]+ (\[Glucose\]/18) + (\[BUN\]/2.8)

    - Osmolar gap= Measured osmolarity – Calculated osmolarity

    - Winter’s formula for respiratory compensation for AGMA: expected
      pCO2 = 1.5 (serum bicarb) +8 +/- 2

      - Shortcut: Expected
          *p**C**O*<sub>2</sub> ≈ last two digits of pH

## General Approach to Acid-Base Derangements

- Step 1: Determine if the patient is acidemic or alkalemic (look at
    the pH)

- Step 2: Determine the primary disorder (metabolic or respiratory)

- Step 3: Calculate anion gap (see section below)

- Step 4: Is there appropriate compensation?

- Step 5: Evaluate for secondary disorders

# Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis

## Background

- Na+ is the predominant cation in normal plasma. Cl- and HCO3- are
    the predominant anions. There are anions that are not directly
    measured (e.g. most binding globulins, immunoglobulins, clotting
    factors, and other proteins). These unmeasured anions are
    responsible for the normal anion gap of \~12 meq/L. When there are
    extra unmeasured anions within the plasma, the anion gap increases

## Differential

- GOLDMARK: Glycols, oxyproline (acetaminophen metabolite), L-lactate,
    D-lactate, methanol, ASA, renal failure/uremia, ketoacids

## Evaluate for secondary disorders

- Corrected bicarbonate
    - Corrected *H**C**O*<sub>3</sub> = patient’s *H**C**O*<sub>3</sub> +
    (patient’s anion gap - 12)

        - Corrected *H**C**O*<sub>3</sub> \> 26, coexisting metabolic
            alkalosis,

        - Corrected HCO3 \<22 coexisting non-AG metabolic acidosis

## Osmolar Gap

- If there is an anion gap, it is worthwhile to always calculate an
    osmolar gap. You will be surprised the number of toxic ingestions
    you catch this way

## Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis (NAGMA)

- There are two places from which people can waste bicarbonate- the
    kidneys and the gut

    - The urine anion-gap, which corresponds to unmeasured urinary NH4+
        (primary means of renal acid excretion), can differentiate between
        the two

    - Urine anion gap = Unmeasured cations (NH4+) – unmeasured anions =
        U­Na + UK – UCl

      - Positive value-\> low NH4+-\> renal losses

          - RTA

          - Carbonic anhydrase inhibition: acetazolamide, topiramate

          - Adrenal insufficiency

          - Normal saline infusion

      - Ne-***GUT***-ive value-\>high NH4+-\>kidneys working
        appropriately-\> GI losses

          - Diarrhea

          - Pancreatic fistula

          - Ureterosigmoidostomy

- Caveat: Proximal RTA has a normal distal urine acidification and has
    a negative urine AG

## Managing Metabolic Acidosis

- Lactic acidosis is the most common cause of anion gap metabolic
    acidosis that we encounter

- In general, avoid use of bicarbonate to treat lactic acidosis

  - Remember: H<sup>+</sup> + HCO3<sup>-</sup> \<-\> H2CO3 \<-\> H2O +
      CO2. While administering bicarbonate will transiently improve pH,
      carbonic acid will eventually form and ultimately worsen acidemia


- In acute NAGMA, reasonable to give bicarbonate when bicarb \<12 or
    pH \<7.1-7.2

- Pay close attention to other electrolyte levels, especially
    potassium as it shifts back into cells

# Metabolic Alkalosis

## Background

- Metabolic alkalosis occurs as a primary disorder or as compensation
    for respiratory acidosis. A thorough history and exam can usually
    clarify which of these two scenarios is occurring

- In order for metabolic alkalosis to occur, there has to be both an
    inciting phase (e.g. volume depletion) and a maintenance phase (e.g.
    hypochloremia or hypokalemia)

## Presentation

- Most symptoms of metabolic alkalosis (confusion, nausea, vomiting,
    tremors) occur as a result of other electrolyte abnormalities
    (hypocalcemia, hypokalemia)

- Serum pH of \>7.55 is likely the threshold where symptoms will
    develop

## Causes

- Saline responsive (e.g. hypochloremia)

    - True volume depletion

    - NG suction/Nausea/vomiting

    - Diuretic use

- Saline refractory

    - Hypokalemia

    - Milk-Alkali syndrome

    - Mineralocorticoid excess states

    - Bartters Syndrome

    - Gitelman’s Syndrome

## Treatment

- Saline Responsive/Hypochloremia

    - If volume deplete, then normal saline is treatment of choice

    - If alkalosis develops in setting of diuresis, then make sure replacing KCl and consider acetazolamide


- Saline refractory

    - Hypokalemia- replenish potassium stores

    - Hyperaldosteronism- covered in more detail in the endocrinology
      section

    - Bartter syndrome and Gitelman syndrome - replace electrolytes and
      refer to nephrology
