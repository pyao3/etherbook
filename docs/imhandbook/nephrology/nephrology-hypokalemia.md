# Hypokalemia 

Peter Thorne and Patrick Steadman

---

## Background

- Potassium (K+) \< 3.5 mEq/L

- 98% of total body K+ is intracellular (majority in muscle cells)

- Goal: prevent life threatening complication (e.g. arrhythmia),
    replace deficit, elucidate cause

- Insulin and catecholamines (Beta adrenoreceptors) are key drivers of
    transcellular shifts

- H+ and K+ will trade places to maintain electroneutrality

## Presentation

- Malaise, weakness, myalgias, decreased gastrointestinal motility

- EKG changes:

    - Mild: ST segment depression, decreased T wave amplitude

    - Severe: U-waves (most commonly seen in precordial leads V2 and V3)

- Severe hypokalemia can lead to rhabdomyolysis

## Evaluation

- History: decreased K+ intake, increased entry into cells (ex:
    elevated beta-adrenergic activity, hypothermia), GI losses, urinary
    losses (diuretics, hypomagnesemia, RTA, tubular defects,
    hyperaldosteronism)

- If concomitant metabolic alkalosis: Normal/low BP suggests diuretic
    use, vomiting or Gitelman/Bartter syndromes

- Hypertension suggests renovascular disease or primary
    mineralocorticoid excess

- Labs: BMP, CBC, VBG, urine electrolytes, magnesium, POC glucose, CK.
    Possibly aldosterone, renin, cortisol pending clinical context

- Imaging: Renal US, CT AP

## Management

- Check Mg+2, replete to 2; Give empirically while waiting for serum
    Mg+2

- K+ preparation (route); replete to 4

- Choice of agent:

    - KCl is used for repletion in the hospital

        - PO tablets for mild asymptomatic hypokalemia

        - IV can be given through peripheral (rate is 10mEq/hr, may have
            burning sensation) or central access

    - K+ bicarbonate can be dissolved and put through G tube

        - Useful in pts with hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis

- Dose:

    - Normal renal function: 10 mEq K+ is expected to raise serum \[K+\]
        by 0.1 mEq/L

    - Significant CKD or AKI: at risk of overcorrection

        - Shortcut: multiply the mEq by the Cr = how much K+ expected to
            rise

        - Once K+ higher than 5.5, K+ increases much faster and rules
            above do not apply
