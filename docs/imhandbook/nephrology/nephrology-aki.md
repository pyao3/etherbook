# Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) 

Terra Swanson

--- 

## Background:

- Definition based on 2012 KDIGO Guidelines: 
    - Rise in serum creatinine (sCr) \> 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours, or
    increase \> 1.5 x baseline in 7 days  
    - Urine volume \<0.5 cc/Kg/H for at least 6 H

## Framework for AKI 

- Pre-renal/hemodynamic AKI:
    - Volume depletion: GI losses, hemorrhage, burns, critical illness
    increased insensible losses 
    - Decreased effective circulating volume: cardiorenal, hepatorenal,
    hemodynamic effects of ACEi/ARB 
    - Afferent arteriole constriction \[NSAIDs, Iodinated contrast\] 
    - Renal vein thrombus 

- Intra-renal: Glomerular, tubular, or interstitial diseases
    - ATN = Most common form of intrinsic AKI. Can be Ischemic or toxic
        - Toxins can be broken down further into endogenous (e.g. rhabdo) and exogenous (e.g. drugs)
    - Acute Interstitial Nephritis (AIN): Usually drug induced (NSAIDs, PPIs, beta lactam abx)  
    - Glomerulonephritis
    - Other causes:  
        - Crystalline nephropathy: IV acyclovir, tumor lysis, ethylene glycol 
        - Small vessel disease: MAHA, TTP, HUS
        - Large vessel disease: Aortic dissection, renal artery stenosis  

- Post-renal: Can occur at any level of the GU system 
    - Ureteral: stones, external compression (malignancy, LAD, abscess) 
    - Bladder: neurogenic bladder, malignancy, obstructing blood clot 
    - Urethra: BPH, prostate cancer, prostatitis  

- Pre-renal azotemia and acute tubular necrosis comprise the majority
    of inpatient acute kidney injuries

## Evaluation 

- History and volume exam

- Labs: CMP, urinalysis, protein/Cr ratio

- 500cc-1L IV fluid challenge: If sCr improves to baseline in \<48H
    then the insult was likely pre-renal. If not, then look for other
    etiologies

- Evaluate for obstruction: I/O cath, Foley, Post Void Residual \>250
    cc

- Who needs a renal ultrasound? 
    - No obvious cause of AKI
    - Abrupt oliguria or anuria (think renal vein thrombus or obstruction)
    - High suspicion for bladder outlet obstruction (PVRs might give you
    same data) 
    - Add doppler to evaluate for renal artery stenosis (or if working up
    resistant hypertension) 

- Urine Electrolytes 
    - FENa \<1% or FEUrea \<33% (if on diuretics) suggest pre-renal physiology
    - Caveat, only validated in *oliguric* patients and more difficult
        to interpret after fluids, diuretics, etc
    - Not needed in the initial work-up of all patients with AKI. If
        high suspicion for pre-renal etiology, trial fluid challenge and
        assess response first

- Urine sodium can be used to assess Na avidity: UNa \> 40 suggests
    ATN and UNa \< 20 suggests pre-renal

## Management

- All causes
    - Minimize fluctuations in blood pressure
    - Consider holding anti-hypertensive medications, especially ACEi/ARB (remember to determine plan to resume at/after discharge)
    - Avoid unnecessary nephrotoxins
    - Dose-adjust medications for changing renal function

- Pre-Renal
    - True volume depletion- Intravenous volume expansion
    - Cardiorenal syndrome- Decongestion/diuresis
    - Hepatorenal syndrome- See Hepatology section for more information

- Post-renal
    - Relieve Obstruction: I/O cath, foley, Urostomy (Urology), percutaneous nephrostomy (IR)
    - Monitor for post-obstructive diuresis

- Intra-renal
    - ATN- supportive care, monitor for post-ATN diuresis. If delayed
    recovery, may need outpatient dialysis
    - Glomerulonephritis- Consult AKI service for assistance with biopsy
    and selecting immunosuppressive agents if needed
    - AIN- Review meds, consult nephrology for possible biopsy and
    recommendations for steroids

- Monitor for renal recovery 
    - Suspect concomitant ATN if sCr declines with volume expansion,
    diuresis, or relief of obstruction but remains a few points above
    baseline

- When to consult Nephrology
    - Urgent indication for dialysis (see “Renal Replacement Therapy”)
    - Abrupt anuria
    - Cr worsening or urine output inadequate w/o clear cause
    - Need for kidney biopsy  

## Additional Information 

- Rhabdomyolysis: UA positive for blood but no RBCs on microscopy
    - Toxic damage due to myoglobin
    - Serologic markers of muscle injury: elevated CK, AST\>AST with normal ALK Phos 
    - Fluids adjusted to urine output goal of 200-300 mL/hr until CK declines
        - Consider isotonic bicarb for initial 1-2L of IVF urine alkalinization to reduce precipitation
    - Avoid calcium repletion for hypocalcemia unless symptomatic 

- Post-obstructive diuresis 
    - Necessary process to clear accumulated uremic toxins
    - Replace \~50% of urine output to prevent pre-renal azotemia
    - Monitor calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium in severe post-obstructive diuresis

# Contrast Induced AKI (CI-AKI)

## Background

- When someone develops an AKI do your due diligence and evaluate for
    the usual causes of AKI, regardless of when they were given contrast

- Mechanism of injury: direct toxic effect leading to tubular necrosis
    and arteriolar vasoconstriction leading to medullary ischemia

## KDIGO Criteria for CI-AKI:
- sCr increase by 0.5mg/dl or 25% increase in sCr from baseline *48 H
    after radiologic procedure where intravenous contrast was
    administered*

## Who is at risk for CI-AKI?

- Normal kidney function: incidence of CI-AKI is 1-3%

- Pre-existing CKD: Incidence of CI-AKI may be as high as 20% in
    patients with CKD 4-5

- Other risk factors include: diabetes, heart failure, and advanced
    age

- No real sCr or eGFR threshold below which iodinated contrast is
    contraindicated, especially in patients for whom imaging will alter
    management (e.g. acute stroke, PE, STEMI)

## Risk reduction strategies

- Volume expansion with isotonic crystalloid (PRESERVE Trial) in
    patients with AKI or eGFR \<30 ml/min/1.73m^2 who are clinically
    hypo or euvolemic
    - 1cc/kg/hr for 6-12 hours before/during and 6-12 hours after the
    procedure in patients at high risk for CI-AKI. This rate can be
    decreased based on the risk for hypervolemia

- If the patient is volume overloaded, they probably should not
    receive volume expansion prior to a contrasted study

- Never delay a necessary procedure out of concern for worsening renal
    function. If in doubt, talk to nephrology

## Iodinated contrast in CKD-5/ESRD patients

- Iodinated contrast does not need to be dialyzed immediately

- Avoid giving if you are trying to preserve residual kidney function
    in ESRD on PD

## Gadolinium contrast for MRI

- Contraindicated in any AKI or if GFR \<30 in CKD given risk of
    nephrogenic systemic fibrosis.
