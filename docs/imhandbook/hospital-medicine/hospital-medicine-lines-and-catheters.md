## Foley Catheter

- Indications: urinary retention, close urine output monitoring in critical illness or renal failure, need for strict I&Os (ex: diuresis) and unable to be achieved without catheter, surgery, open sacral/perineal wounds with incontinence, patient comfort at end of life
    - Urinary incontinence alone is not an indication for foley catheter
    
- Duration of use is biggest risk factor for CAUTI
    - Best way to prevent CAUTI is to avoid inappropriate placement
    - Assess daily whether foley can be removed

- Chronic Foleys generally should be exchanged at time of admission

- Any concern for catheter obstruction (particularly with blood clots) should prompt urgent urology consult for irrigation/intervention (typically after RN has attempted)

- Difficult foley placement
    - Make sure an attempt has been made with a Coudé catheter. This catheter has a curved tip that can be useful in patients with BPH

## PICC

- Single lumen: long term Abx, stable IV access with intermittent draws

- Double lumen: special populations (ICU or chemo), TPN w/ lipids (incompatible with many IV medications)

- Risk factors for CLABSI/VTE: ↑↑duration, ↑↑number of lumens, left arm, lower extremity

- A note on midlines:
    - A midline is just a long PIV inserted into the deep veins in the arm, typically 6-15cm
        - For reference, when you place an US-guided IV, the “long” 18G needles at VUMC are 2.5 inches (~6.4cm)
        - Not much benefit compared to US-guided IV. Useful for stable IV access for meds and fluids. Not a stable route for blood draws

## G-Tube

- Troubleshooting: EGS consult for malposition/not functioning, wound consult for skin breakdown

- G-tube study: 30mL Gastrograffin via tube [resident often must push], and order KUB
