# Wounds − Adapted from Dr. Duggan’s Geriatrics Guide

---

- To do when admitting a patient with wounds:
    - Document ALL wounds that are present on admission. This affects reimbursement

- Use the Haiku app on your cell phone to document images of wounds in chart

- Wound Service hours are Monday through Friday, 6 AM - 2 PM

    - If there is an urgent/emergent wound need (i.e. needs surgical eval or management), consult the appropriate surgical service

    - While awaiting consultation, initiate topical wound care orders (detailed below)

- Consider contributing factors: nutritional, pressure-offloading equipment, wound supplies, PT/OT, home health nursing

## Types of wounds

- Arterial wound - Calciphylaxis

- Venous leg wound - Fistula

- Diabetic foot wound - Abscess

- Vasculitis - Skin tear

- Pyoderma gangrenosum - Pressure injury

- Fungating lesion - Ischemic ulcers / gangrene

## Vascular Wound Etiologies

- Arterial: located on distal ends of digits, shallow, well-defined borders, pale/necrotic wound bed, minimal exudate due to poor blood flow, cramping pain or a constant deep ache

- Diabetic: plantar surface of foot, callused wound margins; usually painless due to neuropathy

- Venous: located on medial malleolus or gravity dependent areas, irregular edges, ruddy red with yellow slough and copious exudate

## Non-Acute Wound Consult Guidelines

- Order “Inpatient Consult to Adult Wound" for these wound types: diabetic foot wounds*, venous, arterial, pressure injuries (consult required for DTI, stage 3, 4, and unstageable), IV infiltrate, skin tears, moisture-associated dermatitis, calciphylaxis, vasculitis, pyoderma gangrenosum, fungating lesion, abscess*, surgical wounds*, or wound VAC

- *Diabetic foot wounds: if pt being followed by podiatry, order "Inpatient Consult to Podiatry"

- *Abscess: if chronic due to IBD, consult colorectal surgery

- *Surgical wounds: if pt has VUMC surgeon, consult the respective surgical service

- Order "Inpatient Consult to Adult Ostomy / Fistula / Tube" for ostomy, trach, PEG, associated needs or complications (etc)

## Acute Wound Consult Guidelines

- Abscess, hematoma, or osteomyelitis with overlying wound – whom to consult for drainage/debridement:
    - Face – Face
    - Chest/Sternum – CT surgery
    - Breast – General surgery
    - Spine – Spine
    - Arm (hand to elbow) – Hand
    - Lower leg (foot to knee) – Ortho
    - Labial – OB/GYN
    - Scrotal – Urology
    - Buttock, thigh (knee to hip), arm (elbow to shoulder) – EGS consult
    - Perirectal/Rectal *acute* abscess – EGS; (*chronic* due to IBD – Colorectal Surgery)
- Necrotizing Fasciitis – whom to consult for URGENT/EMERGENT surgical eval:
    - Genitalia – Urology
    - Buttocks, perineum, abdomen – EGS
    - Upper extremity (shoulder to hand) – Hand
    - Lower extremity (hip to toes) – Ortho

## Wound Care (order while awaiting consultant recs)
- Superficial wounds
    - Stage 1 or 2 pressure injuries, moisture-associated skin damage, or skin tears
        - Order “Adult Skin Care Guidelines” and use the order set to guide you
- Shallow Stage 3 pressure injuries (i.e., <1cm deep) or diabetic foot ulcers
    - Order “Wound Care”: Frequency 2x weekly and prn; Cleanse with NS; protect periwound with Mepilex foam (type in comments)
- Painful superficial wounds with no infection (i.e. vasculitis, PG, calciphylaxis)
    - Order “Wound Care”: Frequency 2 times daily; Cleanse with NS; Apply Vaseline; Protect periwound with Xeroform and dry gauze (type in comments)
        - If wound is on the hand, arm, foot, or lower leg consider wrapping in Kerlix
        - If wound is on the trunk (i.e., abdomen or buttocks), consider covering with an ABD pad and secure with medipore tape

- Infected superficial wounds
    - Odor alone does NOT indicate infection; wounds with necrotic tissue may have odor
    - Order “Wound Care”: Frequency 2 times daily; Cleanse with NS, Apply Silvadene; Protect periwound with Xeroform and dry gauze (type in comments)
        - If wound is on hand, arm, foot, or lower leg consider wrapping in a Kerlix
        - If wound is on the trunk (i.e., abdomen or buttocks), consider covering with an ABD pad and secure with medipore tape

- Medication order required: Silvadene q12h; in Admin Inst put “per wound care orders”

- Deep wounds (i.e., stage 3, 4, or deep diabetic foot wound (all >1cm deep))
    - Order “Wound Care”: Frequency 2 times daily; Cleanse with NS, pack with Dakin’s 0.025% (1/20 strength) soaked continuous Kerlix roll; Protect periwound with ABD pad & medipore tape (type in comments)
    - If wound care is painful, consider changing to daily dressing changes
    - Medication order required: Dakin’s 0.025% solution q12h; in Admin Inst put “per wound care orders”

- Deep tissue injury

    - Medication order required: metrogel q12h; in Admin Inst put “per wound care orders”

- Wound VAC
    - Vanderbilt surgeon – consult Vanderbilt provider to provide care
        - Ensure connected to VUMC wound VAC. Pt shouldn't use home unit while admitted
        - Order “nursing communication” to “Obtain wound VAC hospital machine and canister from service center to connect pt to hospital machine.”
        - Wound VAC should not be left without suction for more than 2 hours
        - Settings: 125 mmHg continuous

- Non VUMC surgeon (i.e., gets wound care at outside hospital/wound care center)
    - Discontinue wound VAC as soon as possible
    - Remove all of the clear plastic drape just like you would remove tape
    - Remove all of the sponge just like you would remove gauze packing
    - Examine the wound to ensure no residual sponge by gently probing site
    - Rinse with saline, initiate care based wound type as above

- Leg wrap
    - Ex: Unna's boot, ACE and 2, 3, or 4 layer compression
    - Remove by cutting the wrap off
    - Assess the wound and order dressing based on type of wound as above
    - Order ACE bandage wrapped toe-to-knee. Remove q12h to assess skin
