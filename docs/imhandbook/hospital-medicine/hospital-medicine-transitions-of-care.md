# Transitions of Care: Tips for Safe Discharges

- Discharge from hospital represents a period of vulnerability for patients. Medical errors (especially medication errors) following discharge are exceedingly common and can lead to adverse events

- At VUMC we are fortunate to have the Discharge Care Center
    - Multidisciplinary team including nurses, social workers, care coordinators, and pharmacists
    - Phone number is included on discharge paperwork and patients can contact them 24/7. The DCC also reaches out to patients through an automated system

- How residents can promote safe discharges:
    - *Communicate with patient’s outpatient team (i.e. PCP)*
        - Typically achieved through the discharge summary
            - Include a list of specific, actionable follow-up tasks and assign a responsible party.
            - Place in easy-to-view spot at the top of the summary
                - Ex: Instead of writing “follow-up BMP after initiation of furosemide,” write “PCP to check BMP in 2 weeks after initiation of furosemide”
                - Include any pending studies and appointments from hospital admission
            - All relevant parties should receive a copy of the discharge summary (see appendices section for mechanics of discharge process)
                - It is useful to send patient with a printed copy of the discharge summary if they will follow-up outside VUMC
                - For high-risk discharges (patients with poor health literacy, hx of being lost to follow-up, patients following up outside VUMC) consider calling PCP’s office to set follow-up

- *Complete an accurate and thorough medication reconciliation*
    - An accurate discharge medication list depends on having a complete admission medication reconciliation (utilize pharmacy consult!)
        - Three steps to medication reconciliation:
            - Verification: Performing a Best Possible Medication History
            - Clarification: Checking that medications and doses are appropriate
            - Reconciliation: Record all medication changes
        - Seek to use at least two sources of information
        - Keep a list of any held or changed medications in your hospital course. Medication changes can be lost when not communicated during team transitions
        - Review medication changes on rounds and with pharmacist on day of discharge (bonus points for day prior to discharge)
    - Highlight any significant medication changes on discharge summary
        - Can include as follow-up tasks if pertinent (ex: PCP to follow-up BP in 2 weeks. Losartan held on d/c due to AKI but anticipate need to reinitiate once Cr normalizes)
    - Be sure to communicate any changes with the patient and/or caregiver

- *Ensure that appropriate resources and follow-up appointments have been requested* (PT/OT, skilled or non-skilled nursing HH, PCP follow-up, etc.)

- *Effectively communicate discharge plan to patient*
    - Discuss medication changes, tasks for patient to complete, follow-up appointments
        - Key points should also be written in the patient instructions box
        - Useful to include educational sheets in the AVS (searchable in discharge navigator)
        - Utilize the teach-back method to ensure your instructions were effectively communicated
