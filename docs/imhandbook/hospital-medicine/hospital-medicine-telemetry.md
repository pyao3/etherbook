# Telemetry 

Ahmad Dbouk and Samuel Lazaroff

---

## Background

- Many monitored pts do not have a true indication
    - Leads to alarm fatigue, unnecessary workups, and is expensive
    
- Telemetry is not a substitute for more frequent vital signs

- Discuss frequently on rounds: always reassess need and indication

- Stable patients without troponin elevation or new arrythmias are typically appropriate for transfers without telemetry

Notable non-indications:

-   PCI for non-ACS indication (i.e. pre-transplant), non-cardiac chest
    pain, Pt with AICD admitted for non-cardiac cause, non-cardiac
    surgery, chronic AF and clinically stable
-   Contraindicated in hospice/comfort care
-   Nearly all noncardiac conditions (i.e.,
    undifferentiated sepsis, stable GI bleed, alcohol withdrawal) upon
    transfer out of ICU
