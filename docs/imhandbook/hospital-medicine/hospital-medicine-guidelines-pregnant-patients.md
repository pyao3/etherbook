## Acute Cystitis:

- Significantly increased prevalence in pregnancy

- Symptoms: dysuria (urgency/frequency common in pregnancy)

- Diagnosis: evidence of pyuria and >103 cfu/ml (note, if neg would test for g/c)

- Treatment: Empiric with cephalexin, cefpodoxime, amoxicillin-clavulanate, fosfomycin. Nitrofurantoin ok in second or third trimester. Avoid Bactrim in first trimester and near term. Tailor based on culture results.

- Note that asymptomatic bacteriuria is treated in pregnancy (in contrast with general public). Same antibiotic choices as above

## Pyelonephritis:

-   Symptoms: fever, flank pain, and nausea/vomiting, dysuria
-   Diagnosis: clinical suspicion + pyuria and bacteriuria
-   Treatment: IV antibiotics for 1 <sup>st</sup> 24-48hrs; beta-lactams
    preferred
-   Mild to moderate: ceftriaxone or cefepime
-   Moderate to severe: piperacillin-tazobactam or meropenem

## Hyperemesis Gravidarum:

-   Presentation: Hormone mediated nausea/vomiting typically starting
    before 9wks GA
-   Differential: gastroenteritis, hepatitis, biliary tract disease,
    obstruction, pancreatitis, pyelonephritis, nephrolithiasis, ovarian
    torsion, DKA, hyperparathyroidism, migraines, preeclampsia
-   Workup: BMP, mg, phos, LFTs, lipase (may be mildly elevated in HG),
    UA,
-   Treatment:
    -   -   First Line: Ginger, doxylamine (25mg PO q6), pyridoxine
            (20mg PO q6)
        -   Second Line: metoclopramide (10mg q6), Promethazine (12.5mg
            q6)
        -   Third Line: ondansetron (8mg q12hrs, after 1st trimester)
        -   Hydration: 1L LR on admission + banana bag q24hrs

## Hypertension:

-   Both gestational HTN and preeclampsia/HELLP are typically
    diagnosed >20w GA
-   Tx options: nifedipine, labetalol, methyldopa, hydral (2
    <sup>nd</sup> line), clonidine (2 <sup>nd</sup> line)
-   Avoid: ACEs, ARBs, MRAs, Nitroprusside

## Diabetes:

-   Due to hormonal changes associated with pregnancy, pregnant patients
    are at higher risk for poor control and DKA
-   Oral regimens are generally transitioned to insulin-based regimens.

## GERD:

-   1st Line: Can use antacids; avoid sodium bicarbonate and magnesium
    trisilicate
-   2nd Line: Sucralfate 1g PO TID
-   3rd Line: Cimetidine 200mg (30min prior to eating)

## Asthma:

-   Similar rescue and controller medications as in non-pregnant patient
-   Would favor using LABA over leukotriene receptor antagonists or
    theophylline for additional therapy
