# Pulmonary Embolism

Anna Berry

---

## Background

A thrombus originating in a deep vein (LE \> UE) embolizing to the
    pulmonary arterial circulation.

- Risk Factors = Virchow’s Triad
    - Stasis: immobilization, hospitalization, spinal cord injury, or long
        travel
    - Hypercoagulable state: cancer, prothrombotic genetic conditions such
        as Factor V Leiden, OCPs, antiphospholipid syndrome, nephrotic
        syndrome, pregnancy, infection, etc.
    - Endothelial Injury: surgery, trauma

Most originate from a DVT in the iliac, femoral, and popliteal veins

## Presentation

- Dyspnea and tachypnea
- Respiratory alkalosis on blood gas from hyperventilation
- Hypoxemia
- Sinus Tachycardia or atrial arrhythmias
- Hemoptysis
- Lower extremity pain, swelling, and redness – occurs in 50% of pts
    with DVT
- RV Failure (large PE) – elevated JVP, hypotension, syncope, R
    parasternal heave, accentuated P2, hepatomegaly

## Evaluation

- If hemodynamically unstable and PE suspected, provide hemodynamic
    support (ie. O2, pressors, etc.) and perform emergent bedside TTE
- If no RV strain evident on TTE, low likelihood of hemodynamically
    significant PE. Consider other causes of shock.

- Hemodynamically stable
    - EKG
        - Most commonly sinus tachycardia
        - Less commonly and indicative of large PE: RAD, RVH, RBBB, RA
            enlargement, S1Q3T3 (deep S in lead I, deep Q and inverted T in
            lead III), TWI in V1-V3
    - CXR: Typically normal. May see linear atelectasis, pleural effusion,
        PA cutoff sign
    - Labs: ABG, troponin, BNP
    - May consider lower extremity dopplers
    - Imaging vs d-dimer based on pre-test probability:
        - Low pre-test probability (use Wells Criteria) d-dimer
        - For moderate to high pre-test probability CTA Chest PE protocol
            - If high pre-test probability or moderate pre-test
                probability with \>4 hour delay in work-up, start empiric
                anticoagulation if bleeding risk is acceptable while work-up
                is ongoing
    - TTE

## tPA Considerations

- Dose is 100mg tPA over 2hrs
- Most effective within 24 hours but effective up to 14d
- Contraindications:
    - Absolute:
        - CNS Pathology: hemorrhagic or ischemic CVA within 3 mo, AVM,
            CNS neoplasm, recent surgery
        - Trauma: Recent head trauma w/ fx or injury
    - Relative
        - Surgery: surgery w/in 3 wks
        - Heme: active bleeding, bleeding diathesis, plt \< 100, oral
            AC
        - Age: \>75 yo, dementia

## Long-term management
