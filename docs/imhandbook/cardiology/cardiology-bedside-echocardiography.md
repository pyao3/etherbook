## Finding an Ultrasound

- MICU: radiology room behind charge nurse’s desk in middle hallway
- VA ICU: In front of resident workspace
- 8N: Behind nurses station before entering cleaning supply room
- 8S: In supply closet to left as your walk toward nursing station -
    (door code is 1-3-5)
- 6MCE: COVID restricted (ask nurses)
- CCU/5N only: supply room on left as entering CCU
- Round wing: 5<sup>th</sup> floor, ask nurses

## TTE Standard Views

### Parasternal long

- Probe position: Rotate probe 180 degrees with right edge of
    probe/probe marker pointing toward patient’s left shoulder
- Make sure probe is centered over mitral valve (In right spot if you
    can see MV and AV)


    - Distance separating the anterior MV leaflet from the septal wall
        as measure of LV systolic function (easy evaluation of systolic
        function)
    - Place M mode spike at tip of mitral leaflet and hit M mode
        (perpendicular to septum)
    - Identify E point (passive filling of LV) and determine distance
        from interventricular septum (IVS)
        - <7mm = Normal
        - >10mm = HF
    - Confounders that elevate EPSS: AR, MS

### Parasternal short

- Probe position: Rotate probe 180 degrees with right edge of
    probe/probe marker pointing toward patient’s left shoulder
- Good position to assess EF by visualizing wall thickening

Apical four chamber

- Probe position: Slide down and look near patient’s left nipple (or
    in the intermammary fold after lifting up breast tissue if needed -
    at PMI if able to palpate)
- Good to assess EF by visualizing cardiac shortening

### Subxiphoid

- Probe position: Push probe head into patient’s abdomen just below
    xiphoid and flatten probe to make nearly parallel to patient’s
    position, marker to pt’s left
- Troubleshooting: shift probe slightly left of midline (toward
    patient’s right) and angle toward heart/right to use liver as
    acoustic window or ask patient to take big breath (moves heart
    closer to probe)
- Best window to visualize pericardial effusion


### IVC

- Probe position: subxiphoid area with probe marker facing toward
    patient’s head tilted slightly left of midline, trace IVC into RA to
    verify correct vessel (vs aorta)
- IVC size and collapsibility used as a surrogate for CVP and RAP
    - <2.1 cm and >50% collapse: RAP ~3mmHg
    - <2.1 cm and < 50% collapse or >2.1cm and >50% collapse: RAP ~8mmHg
    - >2.1cm, <50% collapse: RAP ~ >15mmHg
