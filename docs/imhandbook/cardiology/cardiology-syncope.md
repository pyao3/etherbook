# Syncope

## Background

- Definition: abrupt, transient loss of consciousness with rapid &
    spontaneous recovery  
- Presyncope – symptoms occurring before syncope including
    lightheadedness, tunnel vision/other visual disturbances

## Classification

- Cardiac syncope 
- Tachyarrhythmias: VT, SVT 
- Bradyarrhythmias: sinus node dysfunction, AV blocks (high grade) 
- Structural: Aortic Stenosis, HCM, cardiac tamponade, congenital
    anomalies, masses/tumors 
- Vascular: Pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, severe pHTN 
- Noncardiac syncope
- Reflex mediated
    - Vasovagal; most common form of reflex mediated syncope
        - Can occur sitting/standing or with trigger (stress, pain,
            medical settings)
        - Classically has prodrome of nausea, diaphoresis, tunnel
            vision followed by hypotension and/or bradycardia
    - Situational (micturition/defecation/coughing)
    - Carotid sinus sensitivity syndrome
- Orthostatic
- Medications (diuretics, nitrates/CCB/alpha blockers, TCAs)
- Volume depletion (hemorrhage, dehydration)
- Autonomic dysfunction

## Differential diagnosis

- Seizure, stroke, metabolic derangements, Intoxication/withdrawal,
    hypoglycemia, head trauma
- With rare exceptions, these do not result In complete LOC with
    spontaneous recovery

## Evaluation

- History and physical are essential for evaluation of a syncopal
    event 
- Characteristics associated with cardiac syncope 
- Male, \>60, known structural/ischemic heart disease, brief/no
    prodrome, syncope while supine/at rest or during exercise, family hx
    of SCD/premature death, abnormal exam 
- Characteristics associated with noncardiac syncope
- Younger age, syncope while standing or with positional changes,
    prodrome (nausea, vomiting, warmth), specific triggers, previous
    episodes that have been similar  

## Workup

- EKG on all patients with syncope, monitor those who are admitted on
    telemetry
- CBC, CMP, troponin, BNP (If cardiac cause suspected), POC glucose,
    UDS, orthostatic VS
- EEG and neuroimaging if concern for seizure activity or focal neuro
    deficit  
- TTE and consider stress testing particularly in exertional syncope  

## Management

- Cardiac: managed as indicated based on pathology 
- If arrhythmia is suspected but not captured on admission, consider
    discharge with event monitor  

- Noncardiac
- Reflex
    - Vasovagal- consider tilt table testing If recurrent or diagnosis
        not clear
    - Situational- mainly avoiding triggers
    - Carotid sinus syndrome- may require PPM

- Orthostatic
    - Medication related
        - Appropriate to hold potentially offending medications
            (diuretics, vasodilators) during evaluation
        - Monitor for worsening supine hypertension, arrhythmias, or
            heart failure when holding
    - Volume depletion; resuscitate as appropriate
    - Autonomic dysfunction: see autonomics section

- Driving: TN law does not require any MD to inform the state of TLOC 
- Should still recommend patients not drive while work-up ongoing.
    Document all conversations about driving with patients
