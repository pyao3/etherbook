# Acute Coronary Syndromes

Anna Berry

---

## Background
-   Completely or partially occluding thrombus on a disrupted
    atherothrombotic coronary plaque leading to myocardial
    ischemia/infarction
-   STEMI: Elevated troponin & elevation in ST segment or new LBBB with
    symptoms
    - \> 0.1 mV in at least 2 contiguous leads
    - Exception, in V2-V3:
      - \> 0.2 mV in men older than 40 y/o
      - \> 0.25 in men younger than 40 y/o
      - \> 0.15 mV in women
-   NSTEMI: Evidence of myocardial necrosis (elevated troponin) w/o ST
    segment elevation
-   Unstable Angina: Angina without evidence of myocardial necrosis
    (normal troponin)
-   Other causes of myocardial injury: coronary spasm, embolism,
    imbalance of oxygen demand and supply 2/2 fever, tachycardia,
    hypo-/hypertension

## Presentation

-   Classic Angina: dyspnea on exertion, substernal, pressure or
    vice-like quality, improved with rest. Note that response
    nitroglycerin is no longer in the guidelines.
-   Anginal Equivalents: nausea, weakness, epigastric pain (esp. in age
    \> 65 y/o, women, diabetics)
-   Change in patient’s baseline angina, especially onset at rest
-   Physical Exam: sinus tachycardia, diaphoresis
-   If large infarct, can present with symptoms of acute heart failure

## Evaluation

- EKG: Compare to prior EKG and assess for
    - New ST elevations or ST depressions
    - T wave inversions: not specific but more concerning if deep (\>
        0.3mV)
    - Biphasic T waves and deep T wave inversions in leads V2 & V3
        (Wellens' sign \[LAD\])
- Cardiac biomarkers: troponin I is most sensitive for myocardial
    injury
- ACC/AHA guidelines recommend both EKG and trop q2-6 hours
    - Consider this if high suspicion for ACS despite normal initial
        markers
    - If negative x2, OK to stop trending
- Other labs: lipid panel, TSH, A1C

## Management

### STEMI

- STAT page Cardiology on call via Synergy (whether in VA or
    Vanderbilt)
- ASAP: aspirin 325mg, heparin drip (high nomogram, with bolus)
- Hold P2Y12 receptor blocker until discussed with cards fellow

### NSTEMI
- Medical management followed by left-heart catheterization within 48
    hours
- General: bedrest, telemetry, repeat EKG with recurrent chest pain,
    NPO at midnight
- Place cath case request (see “pre-catheterization” management below)

### Anti-thrombotic therapy

Antiplatelet agents

- ASA 325 mg loading dose then 81 mg daily after
- Do not give P2Y12 receptor blocker until discussed with
        cardiology fellow
- Clopidogrel: prodrug that is metabolized to active form (can
            have undermetabolizers), irreversible inhibition
- Ticagrelor: reversible inhibitor
- Prasugrel: prodrug but more rapidly metabolized than
            clopidogrel with less variation, irreversible inhibition, do
            not use w/ age \> 75 or weight \< 60 kg
- Prasugrel and ticagrelor are superior to clopidogrel but
            have higher bleeding risk
- Cangrelor: IV, rarely used

Anti-coagulants

- Unfractionated heparin drip
- Type this in Epic and select “nursing managed” protocol for
        “ACS”
- VA: it can be found under the “Orders” tab along the left-hand
        column.
- Enoxaparin (LMWH) can be used but requires preserved renal
        function (CrCl \> 30) and most interventionalists prefer heparin
        prior to LHC

### Pre-Catheterization Care

- Ensure pt. is NPO at MN for planned cath
- Continue anticoagulation with heparin gtt
- Place cardiac catheterization request (must be in cardiology
    context). Can also call cath lab to ensure pt. is scheduled
    appropriately

### Post-Catheterization Care Catheterization Documentation

- The most appropriate guidance for post-cath care is in the cardiac
    catheterization report
- VUMC: Epic Cardiac tab Cardiac Catheterization/Intervention Report
- VA: Note tab Post-Procedure note and Cardiac Catheterization note
- If there is a delay in filing the final report at VUMC: Review the
    Cardiac Catheterization Nursing Documentation which shows if stents
    were deployed

### Post-Catheterization Heparin

- Medical management w/o intervention: stop heparin unless directed in
    report
- If indication for CABG (ex: Left main, proximal LAD), continue
    heparin gtt until surgery
- PCI placed: stop heparin and continue/start DAPT as directed by
    cardiology
- Other medical indication for anticoagulation (DVT/PE, atrial
    fibrillation): restart \~ six hours after catheterization

### Cath Site Checks

- 6 - 8 hours post catheterization (typically can be signed out as
    0000 cath check), only needed for femoral arterial access
- Look, listen, feel: evaluate for hematoma & pseudoaneurysm; call
    fellow if concerned
- Small amount of bruising and mild tenderness at the site is normal
- Listen above and below the site for a bruit; the area should be soft
- Hypotension after femoral access is concerning for RP bleed
    - STAT CBC, CT A/P & call the cardiology fellow
- Femoral oozing: Cardiology fellow, will need to hold pressure
- Radial oozing: instruct nurse to re-inflate the TR band and restart
    the clock on deflation

### Post ACS Care

-   Echo prior to discharge
-   DAPT: Aspirin 81 mg daily and P2Y12 agent
-   Beta blocker in all patients within 24 hours
  -   Metoprolol, carvedilol & bisoprolol have proven mortality benefit
      with reduced EF
-   High intensity statin (ex: rosuvastatin 40 or atorvastatin 80). See
    outpatient lipids section
-   ACEi/ARB if anterior STEMI
-   Lifestyle Modification: weight loss, smoking cessation, diabetes
    control
-   See heart failure section for management of HFrEF

### ACS Complications

-   VT/VF, sinus bradycardia, third-degree heart block, new VSD, LV
    perforation, acute mitral regurgitation, pericarditis and
    cardiogenic shock; More common with STEMI CCU post-cath

### Additional Information

-   Initiate treatment if there is true concern for ACS and bleeding
    risk acceptable, medications can always be discontinued
-   TIMI score: \>2 correlates with ↑ mortality, indicating a need for
    aggressive treatment
-   ACC Guideline Clinical App is a useful resource with summaries of
    guideline-based recs
