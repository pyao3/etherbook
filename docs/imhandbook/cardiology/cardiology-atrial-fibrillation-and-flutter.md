# Atrial Fibrillation & Flutter

Brittany Saldivar

---

## Background

- AF: 12-lead EKG with absence of p-waves and irregularly irregular
    QRS complexes
- Flutter: sawtooth atrial F waves (300 BPM) with regular or regularly
    irregular QRS complexes
- Ventricular rate ratio of F waves: V waves \~150 (2:1), \~100 (3:1),
    or \~75 (4:1)
- 3 classifications
    - Paroxysmal (terminates within 7 days)
    - Persistent (persisting beyond 7 days)
    - Permanent (normal rhythm cannot be restored)
- Rapid ventricular response (RVR) is HR \> 100 (ie AF/Flutter w/
    tachycardia)
- AF/RVR is far more often a consequence of hypotension than the cause
    of it

## Evaluation

- Causes: Mnemonic “H PIRATES”
    - Hypertension
    - Pneumonia, Pericarditis, Post-op
    - Ischemia (rare)
    - Rheumatic Valve
    - Atrial Myxoma or Accessory Pathway
    - Thyrotoxicosis
    - Ethanol or Excess Volume
    - Sick sinus, Sepsis

## Management

- Treatment goals
    - Rate control, Goal HR \< 110 (RACE II)
    - Rhythm control (if indicated)
    - Stroke prevention

Rate control (inpatient)

- RVR \~ sinus tach of AF; Always work to address the underlying cause
    (infection, volume overload, etc). Rate control is rarely an
    emergency unless the patient is unstable
- If stable with RVR (SBP \>90)
    - IV if HR \> 130 or symptomatic (metop 5 mg IV or dilt 15-20 mg
        IV), otherwise do PO
    - AV nodal blocking agents
        - B-blockers: Start with metop tartrate (titratable)
          consolidate to succinate. Avoid in decompensated or
          borderline HF
        - Calcium channel blockers (diltiazem): avoid in HFrEF
- Peri stable (SBPs 80s-90 with preserved perfusion)
    - Amiodarone: Consider if decompensated HF, accessory pathway,
        anti-coagulated. Caution that you may cardiovert pt (stroke
        risk)
- Unstable (SBPs \<80)
    - Cardioversion

Rate control (outpatient)

- typically achieved with beta blocker therapy,
  metoprolol is most frequently used

Rhythm control (inpatient)

- New onset a-fib (first time diagnosis): most pts will be a candidate
    for trial of cardioversion
- If onset clearly within 48 hours, can proceed without TEE. Often TEE
    is done anyway (pt may have had intermittent asymp AF)
- If onset \>48 hours or unclear, will need TEE to rule out LAA
    thrombus
- Pharmacologic options include class 1C: flecainide, propafenone
    (avoid in structural heart disease) and class 3: Amiodarone,
    dronedarone, sotalol, ibutilide, dofetilide (some require loading
    inpt)
      - Caution using antiarrhythmics in any pt you wouldn't
        electrically cardiovert without TEE

Rhythm control (outpatient)

- Consider EP consult for ablation in symptomatic paroxysmal or
    persistent AF refractory to anti-arrhythmic drugs, AF in HFrEF, or
    flutter
- Stroke Prevention (for AF and flutter)
    - CHA2DS2-VASc risk score \>2 in M or \>3 in F should prompt long term
    AC in AF persisting \>48 hours
    - NOACs (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban) are preferred to
    warfarin except in moderate to severe MS or mechanical valve
- If cardioversion planned for new onset AF, start AC as soon as
    possible
      - Post-cardioversion, anticoagulate for at least 4 weeks due to
        atrial stunning and stroke risk
- If no contraindications or procedures, continue anticoagulation
    while inpatient
- Typically do not need to bridge AC for AF in the setting of
    procedures unless mechanical valve is present. Decide on a case
    by-case basis
- Left atrial appendage closure can be considered in those with
    increased risk of bleeding
