## Background

- Hypertensive urgency: SBP \> 180mmHg/DBP \> 120mmHg
- Hypertensive emergency: SBP \> 180mmHg/DBP \> 120mmHg + end organ
    damage

## Evaluation

- Are there signs/symptoms of end organ damage?
- Neurologic symptoms: agitation, delirium, stupor, seizures, visual
    disturbances
- Focal neurologic deficits
- Chest pain
- Back pain (consider aortic dissection)
- Dyspnea (consider pulmonary edema)
- BMP, LFTs, Troponin, BNP: Lab findings suggestive of end-organ
    damage

## Management

- Goal is to lower BP back to normal over 24-48 hours
- Initial lowering should be 10-20% in minutes if HTN emergency; goal
    should be 10-20% in 2-4 hours if HTN urgency
- Typically aim for initial goal BP near 160/110
- Exceptions to gradual lowering include:
    - Acute stroke: call code stroke, lower ONLY if BP \> 185/110 in
        pts under consideration for reperfusion therapy; or BP \>
        220/120 in pts not candidates for reperfusion therapy
    - Aortic dissection: Goal = rapidly lower BP in minutes to target
        of 100-120 systolic to avoid aortic shearing forces
- Pharmacologic therapy
    - If pt was previously on anti-HTN meds, ensure their home medicines
        have been restarted at appropriate doses, formulation (long acting
        vs. short), and dosing intervals
    - If pt has a rapid acting anti-HTN med, can consider giving a dose
        early or an “extra dose” and then up titrating their overall daily
        dose
- Rescue therapies
    - Captopril PO (12.5mg or 25mg dosed Q8H; conversion ratio of
        captopril:lisinopril = 5:1)
    - Hydralazine PO (10-20mg initial dosing Q6H)
    - Isosorbide dinitrate PO (5-20mg TID)
    - Nifedipine XL PO (dose at 30mg initially, max 90 mg BID; NOT
        sublingual)
    - Labetalol IV (10-40mg initially; dosed up to every 20-30mins)
    - Hydralazine IV (10-20mg initially; dosed up to every 30 mins).
    - Nitropaste 1” (can add/wipe away for titration; dose Q6H until
        oral meds can be started for better long-acting control)
- Dialysis if missed session

## Additional Information

- Refractory HTN: try additional agents listed above vs. escalation of
    care for drip (nicardipine, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, esmolol).

- Most drips that can be done for this indication are done in stepdown
    and usually require no-titration of the infusion and occasionally
    the MD to be bedside to initiate the infusion.

- This includes diltiazem, labetalol, nitroglycerin, and verapamil
    drips. Nicardipine, esmolol, and nitroprusside drips are not allowed
    on step down.
