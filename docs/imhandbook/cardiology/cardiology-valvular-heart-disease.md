## Etiology

- Degenerative calcification of the aortic cusps
- Congenital bicuspid aortic valve
- Chronic deterioration (calcific)
- Prior rheumatic fever/inflammation

## Presentation

- Angina, syncope, exertional dyspnea, heart failure (HF carries worse
    prognosis)
- Typically aged 70 – 80 y/o; if bicuspid aortic valve expect 10-20
    yrs earlier
- Physical exam: Systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur that radiates
    towards the carotids
- Late peaking murmur, faint or absent S2, or delayed carotid upstroke
    suggest severe AS

## Evaluation

- TTE with doppler is test of choice

AS stages

- A: at risk of AS (those with bicuspid anatomy or calcification
- B: Asymptomatic non-severe AS
- C: asymptomatic AS
    - C1: normal EF
    - C2: abnormal EF
        - This stage might benefit from exercise or stress testing to
          elicit symptoms
- D: Symptomatic AS

- Some with symptomatic AS might not have enough LV reserve to produce
    high velocities and gradients (ex EF of 10% w/ critical valve area)
    = low flow/low gradient AS; consider dobutamine to unmask AS

## Management

- No proven effective medical therapy
- Definitive treatment is valve replacement for:
    - Stage D
    - Stage C with inducible symptoms on stress testing, low EF, or
        undergoing other cardiac procedure
    - Rapid progression (increase in velocity \>0.3m/sec per year)
- Consult cardiac surgery for determination of SAVR vs TAVR
    - In general, high risk surgical patients benefit most from TAVR
    - At VUMC: If determined to be intermediate to high operative risk by
        Cardiac Surgery, they will often recommend contacting the TAVR team
        for evaluation
- Avoid rapid hemodynamic shifts and aggressive changes in preload or
    afterload
- Aim for normotension
    - Avoid preferential vasodilators such as
    hydralazine or nitroglycerin
    - Significant vasodilation may ↓ coronary filling pressures -\>
    myocardial ischemia

## Monitoring

- Severe AS: TTE q 6-12 months
- Moderate AS: TTE q 1-2 years
- Mild AS: TTE q 3-5 years

## Post AVR anticoagulation

- All patients will get 3-6 months of AC s/p AVR
- Continued duration based on type of AVR
    - Bioprosthetic (TAVR and some SAVRs): antiplatelets alone after
        Initial AC
    - Mechanical: lifelong AC with warfarin only


# Aortic Regurgitation

Jonathan Napper 

---

## Etiology

- Primary valve disease (rheumatic disease, bicuspid aortic valve,
    infective endocarditis, syphilis)
- Primary aortic root disease (medial degeneration, aortic dissection,
    Marfan’s syndrome, bicuspid aortic valve, syphilis, non-syndromic
    familial)

## Presentation

- Acute AR: LV cannot respond to increased volume to maintain stroke
    volume pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock
- Chronic AR: indolent presentation, often patient will develop
    symptoms of heart failure including DoE, orthopnea, PND
- Physical exam: “Water-hammer” pulses, wide pulse pressure, laterally
    displaced PMI, high pitched “blowing” decrescendo murmur best heard
    at third intercostal space at left sternal border, S3

## Management

- Acute severe AR
    - Prompt surgical repair
    - Vasodilators such as nitroprusside and diuretics can be used to
        stabilize patient
- Chronic severe AR
    - Medical management
    - Early symptoms of exercise intolerance can be treated with
        diuretics
    - Systolic BP should also be controlled with goal SBP \< 140 in
        chronic AR

- Repeat imaging should be performed 3-6 month to assess for depressed
    LVEF or LV dilation

- Stages of Chronic AR: Ranging from Stage (A): Asymptomatic but “At
    Risk” AR to Stage (D) Symptomatic Severe AR
      - If symptoms are present, automatically Stage D, otherwise
        Progression through stages is determined by AR Jet Width
- Class I indications for Valve Repair:
    - Stage D (Symptomatic) or Stage C (Asymptomatic Severe AR)
      with LVEF \< 55%, or are undergoing other
      cardiac surgery
    - If LVEF \> or equal 55%, patients should be considered for
            surgery if LV is dilated (LVESD \> 50 mm (class IIa) or LVEDD \>
            65 mm (class IIb))
    - Any patient with progressive AR, even if they do not meet criteria
        for severe AR, should consider valve replacement if undergoing
        cardiac surgery for other reasons
    - Note: TAVI for isolated chronic AR is challenging 2/2 dilation
            of the aortic annulus and root

# Mitral Regurgitation

Marcus Threadcraft

---

## Etiology

- Primary MR – caused by direct involvement of the valve apparatus
    (leaflets or chordae tendineae)
- Degenerative/myxomatous mitral valve disease (mitral valve prolapse
    with flail leaflet, mitral annular calcification, chordal rupture)
- Rheumatic fever
- Infective endocarditis
- Papillary muscle rupture following acute (inferior) MI
- Secondary MR- caused by changes of the LV that lead to valvular
    incompetence
- Dilated Cardiomyopathy
- HOCM with systolic anterior motion
- Coronary Artery Disease or prior MI leading to papillary muscle
    tethering

## Presentation

- Acute MR- sudden onset reduction in forward cardiac flow and left
    atrial/pulmonary vein volume overload
- Dyspnea with flash pulmonary edema
- Left-sided heart failure
- Chronic MR- progressive symptoms d/t cardiac remodeling to
    compensate for mitral flow reversal
- Progressively worsening heart failure: dyspnea, orthopnea, PND
- LV dilation from volume overload
- LA remodeling/dilation leading to afib

## Auscultation

- Holosystolic Murmur
- Best heard at Apex
- Radiation to the Axilla
- Frequently associated with S3
- Murmur may be absent in acute MR due to large regurgitant
    orifice/low velocity regurgitant jet
- Increases w/ increased preload or afterload
- Pulmonary Rales

## Evaluation

- CXR: assess for pulmonary edema, r/o other causes of acute dyspnea
- ECG: often non-specific, LVH
- Echocardiography: assess valve apparatus, size, and function of
    LA/LV, grade severity of MR

## Chronic MR stages

- A: No symptoms
- B: \>mild MR w/o hemodynamic changes or symptoms
- C: Severe MR w/o symptoms
    - C1: preserved EF and normal LV size
    - C2: reduced EF (\<60%), dilated LV (LVESD \> 40mm)
- D: Severe/symptomatic

## Management

Acute hemodynamically significant MR

- Urgent surgical repair or replacement
- Medical stabilization as a bridge to surgery
    - Afterload reduction is key to promote forward flow
    - Vasodilators (nitroprusside, nitroglycerin) reduce afterload
    - Diuresis to reduce preload and improve pulmonary edema
    - IABP placement can be used as mechanical afterload reduction

Chronic severe primary MR

- Surgical repair favored over valve replacement
- Class I:
    - Asymptomatic patients w/ LVEF 30-59% or LVESD \> or equal 40mm
    - Symptomatic patients w/ EF \> 30%
- Class II:
    - A: asymptomatic patients with progressive EF decline or LV
        dilation on serial monitoring; or very severe MR
    - B: new onset AF
- Secondary MR can consider MV repair with persistent class III-IV
    symptoms while on guideline directed medical therapy
- In HFrEF, consider MitraClip after volume optimization (see Heart
    Failure section)

# Mitral Stenosis

Marcus Threadcraft

---

# Etiology

Characterized by thickened mitral valve leaflets and fused
leaflet tips.

- Rheumatic Fever (leading cause worldwide)
- Calcification of the mitral valve annulus (common in high income
    countries)
- Autoimmune Diseases: SLE, Rheumatoid arthritis

## Presentation

- Progressive symptoms: Asymptomatic Heart Failure
- Orthopnea
- PND
- Hoarseness/Dysphagia (compression of recurrent laryngeal
    nerve/esophagus by enlarged left atrium from pressure overload)
- Symptoms of Right Heart Failure
- Acute Symptoms may present in settings of increased cardiac output
    (pregnancy, sepsis, or exercise) or tachyarrhythmias
- Dyspnea
- Fatigue
- Palpitations

## Physical exam

- Low-pitched rumbling, diastolic Murmur, best heard at apex,
    low-pitched, rum
    - Loud S1, opening snap after S2
    - Prominent P2 if pulmonary HTN develops
- Pulmonary Rales

## Evaluation

- CXR: LA enlargement, increased pulmonary vasculature
- Echocardiography: thickening of mitral valve leaflets, decreased
    area of valve leaflets, left atrial enlargement

## Management

- Varies between rheumatic MS and calcific MS (in general,
    intervention of calcific MS is very challenging and high risk)
- Severe, symptomatic rheumatic MS:
    - Percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy (PMBC)
    - Surgical repair/replacement if patient failed PMBC or undergoing
    other cardiac surgery
- Calcific MS has a poor prognosis with 5-year survival \<50%,
    Intervention is higher risk and should be reserved for severely
    symptomatic patients

- No role for commissurotomy with calcific MS
- Surgical valve replacement may be considered for severely
    symptomatic patients (technically challenging)

## Anti-Coagulation

- Anti-coagulation is indicated if:
    - Mechanical prosthetic mitral valve
        - Warfarin, goal INR 3-4 lifelong
    - Bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement
        - Warfarin, goal INR 2-3 for first 3-6 months
    - Atrial Fibrillation regardless of CHADS2VASC score
