## Types of Cardiac Implantable Electronic Devices (CIED)

- For Controlling Arrhythmias: Implantable Pulse Generators
- Pacemakers: Anti-bradycardia pacing
- ICDs: Anti-tachycardia pacing and defibrillation
- Biventricular Pacemakers: CRT for ventricular dyssynchrony (LBBB &
    Heart Failure)
- Loop Recorders: implantable devices for monitoring arrhythmias (most
    often Afib)
- LVADs: augment cardiac output for end-stage heart failure (not
    covered here)

### Pacemakers

- Provide anti-bradycardia pacing by stimulating myocardium
- Peripheral permanent pacemakers (PPMs)
- SubQ generator, transvenous leads
    - Single chamber RV lead
    - Dual chamber RV and RA leads
    - BiV: RV, RA, and LV (coronary sinus) leads
- Leadless pacemaker
    - Implanted generator in RV

Indications

- Symptomatic Bradycardia
- Heart Block: 2nd Degree Type II w/ sx or 3rd Degree
- Sick Sinus Syndrome
- Carotid Sinus Syndrome
- After catheter ablation of AV node for AF
- CRT

### Implantable Cardioverter/Defibrillators (ICDs)

- Pacing lead + defibrillation coil
- Detect and treat VT/VF v
    - Anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP)- attempts to entrain and terminate
        VT
    - Defibrillation If ATP unsuccessful

Indications

- Primary prevention
    - HFrEF
        - EF \<35% and NYHA II-III or EF \<30% and NYHA I
        - Must be \>90d from revasc, \>40d from MI, and on GDMT
    - Arrhythmogenic syndromes
        - Arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy, Brugada syndrome, HCM and
            cardiac sarcoid with specific risk factors
- Secondary prevention
    - Hx VF arrest or VT
    - Inducible VT on EP study with history of syncope

### Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT)

- BiV pacer that coordinates LV/RV contraction through synchronized
    activation of each ventricle following atrial contraction.
- -P: CRT pacing only
- -D: ICD function

Indications

- Class I: LBBB and QRS≥150 with EF\<35%, NYHA II- IV, on GDMT, NSR
- Class IIa: EF\<35%, NYHA II- IV, on GDMT, NSR AND
    - LBBB & QRS 120-149, non-LBBB & QRS≥150, or EF\<35% and expected
        to require \>40% ventricular pacing

### Interpreting Pacemaker Codes

|                                                                              | 1st Letter    | 2nd Letter     | 3rd Letter              | 4th Letter       |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| A: atrial, V: ventricular, D: dual, O: none, I: inhibition, R: rate-adaptive | Chamber Paced | Chamber Sensed | Response to Sensed Beat | Program Features |

### Examples of Common Pacing Modes

- VVI: Single RV lead that delivers a beat if no beat sensed. Often
    used with chronic AF with bradycardia
- DDDR: Senses and paces both the atria and ventricle. If beat not
    sensed within a predefined interval, beat delivered. R indicates
    rate responsivity (changes rate based on changes in patient
    activity)
- Magnet: Paces at a fixed rate without respect to native electrical
    activity (AOO,VOO,DOO). Deactivates ICD shock. Often used in surgery
    or at end of life to avoid ICD shocks

### Additional Configurations

- Epicardial Leads- pacemaker/defibrillator leads attached to outside
    of the heart (requires OR) vs traditional transvenous lead
    placement, which are inserted in the Cath Lab
    - Epicardial Leads generally placed in smaller children or during
        cardiac surgery with expected need for pacing/defibrillation
- Abandoned leads
    - Absolute contraindication to MRI (ungrounded, produces heat and
        thermal Injury In setting of magnetic field)

### Placement Complications

- Acute: pocket hematoma, pneumothorax, myocardial perforation,
    cardiac tamponade, infection, lead displacement or disconnection
- Long-term: secondary device infection, lead fracture (lead lifetime
    10-15 years), insulation failure
