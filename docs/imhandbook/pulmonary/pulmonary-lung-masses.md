# Lung Masses 

Chandler Montgomery

## Background

- Definitions: lesion \< 3 cm = pulmonary nodule. Lesion \> 3 cm =
    lung mass

    - Pulmonary nodules are common and often benign, but presence of lung
        mass (\>3cm) should prompt workup as chance of malignancy is high
        (\>50%)

    - For nodules, refer to the Fleischner Society guidelines (incidental
        nodules) or Lung-RADS (detected on lung cancer screening) for
        surveillance/management recommendations

    - Note that in TN, prior histoplasmosis is a very common cause of
        pulmonary nodules

- Differential diagnosis:

    - Malignant:

        - Primary non-small cell lung cancer (NCSLC): adenocarcinoma,
            squamous cell (SCC), large cell carcinoma

        - Metastatic: commonly melanoma, sarcoma, colon, breast, renal,
            testicular

            - Often multiple nodules/masses (e.g., cannonball) 

        - Neuroendocrine: small cell lung cancer (SCLC), carcinoid, large
            cell neuroendocrine

    - Infectious:

        - Granulomatous: TB, non-TB mycobacterium, endemic fungal (histo,
            blasto, coccidio)

            - May have component of calcification

        - Abscess: Staph aureus, Klebsiella, anaerobes, polymicrobial
            (aspiration)

        - Septic emboli, hydatid cyst, aspergilloma

    - Other: hamartoma, AVM, pulmonary infarct, inflammatory nodule (GPA,
        RA), sarcoidosis

## Evaluation

- History: smoking, cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, chest pain, weight
    loss, fevers, night sweats, hoarseness, bone pain, neuro deficits

    - Lung cancer should always be considered in a patient with smoking
        history & new cough or hemoptysis

- Exam: cachexia, lymphadenopathy, bone pain, hepatomegaly, neuro
    deficits

- Imaging:

    - CXR has poor sensitivity for lung nodules, may show large mass or
        malignant effusion

    - CT chest (with contrast if possible - better evaluation of
        mediastinum/LNs)

        - Review prior chest imaging to assess age and growth pattern of
            lesion(s)

        - Benign features: small (sub-centimeter), calcified, fat
            attenuation, stable over 2 years, multiple nodules

        - Concerning features: large, growth, spiculation, upper lobe
            location, thick-walled cavitation, mediastinal invasion

        - Location- adenocarcinoma often more peripheral, SCC often more
            central, SCLC associated with massive LAD, mediastinal invasion,
            large hilar masses

- Look for paraneoplastic syndromes:

    - SCLC: SIADH, Lambert-Eaton, Cushing’s syndrome

    - SCC: hypercalcemia (PTHrP)

    - Dermatomyositis, polymyositis, hypertrophic osteoarthropathy

## Staging/Diagnosis

- Imaging: CT chest (with contrast if possible)m CTAP w/contrast vs.
    PET/CT to assess for metastasis, consider MRI brain if clinical
    stage III or IV disease

- Biopsy: careful planning is key

    - For metastatic disease, obtain tissue from least invasive site

        - FNA or excision of palpable lymph node (cytology department,
            US-guided procedure, or EGS)

    - If uncertain how to best obtain tissue, consult IR, interventional
        pulm, and/or oncology to discuss approach

        - Surgical Bx: Wedge resection/lobectomy often preferred if
            solitary nodule amenable to both diagnostic and therapeutic
            resection in good surgical candidate

        - Bronchoscopy with EBUS (endobronchial US) often used to obtain
            biopsy of mediastinal tissue or central/peri-bronchial lesion

        - Trans-thoracic needle aspiration (TTNA): peripheral lesions not
            amenable to bronchoscopy

## Management

- Planning is complex, usually discussed at multidisciplinary tumor
    board

- NSCLC

    - Stage I/II: surgical resection +/- adjuvant chemotherapy

    - Stage III: more complex requiring multidisciplinary approach

    - Stage IV: chemo +/- targeted therapy depending on PD-L1 expression,
        presence of driver mutations for EGFR, ALK, ROS-1, BRAF, MET, RET,
        others

- SCLC: usually widely metastatic at time of diagnosis, treated with
    systemic chemo/radiation
