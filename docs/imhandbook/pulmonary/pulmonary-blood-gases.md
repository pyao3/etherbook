## Did you order an ABG or VBG?

- Need to assess oxygenation ABG

- Need to assess hypoventilation May use VBG. ABG if shock, severe
    hypercapnia

- pH VBG usually correlates with an ABG (venous pH is \~0.04 lower
    than arterial pH)

    - Less accurate in shock or severe acid-base disturbance

- ABGs are obtained by respiratory both at VUMC and the VA

- VBGs can be ordered like other labs on the floor. Ran as point of
    care test (iSTAT) in the ICU

## Assessing Oxygenation:

- A-a gradient = PAO2 (alveolar O2) – PaO2 (arterial O2)

    - PAO2 = FiO2 (Pbarom - PH2O) - PaCO2/R

        - FiO2 = 0.21 on room air otherwise obtain from ventilator

        - Pbarom = 760, PH2O = 47

        - R (respiratory quotient) = 0.8

        - PaCO2 = arterial CO2 measured on ABG

        - Normal A-a gradient = (Age +10)/4

    - See hypoxia section for ddx of increased A-a gradient

## Assessing Acid/Base Status and Ventilation:

- Look at the pH (normal = 7.35 – 7.45): pH \< 7.35 = acidosis; pH \>
    7.45 = alkalosis

- Look at the pCO2 (normal = 35-45 mmHg)

| Primary Disorder      | pH      | pCO2 |
|-----------------------|---------|------|
| Respiratory Acidosis  | \< 7.35 | \>45 |
| Respiratory Alkalosis | \> 7.45 | \<35 |
| Metabolic Acidosis    | \< 7.35 | \<45 |
| Metabolic Alkalosis   | \> 7.45 | \>35 |

- Is the primary disorder acute vs. chronic?

- Is the primary disorder appropriately compensated?

- If not appropriately compensated, what additional process is
    present?

## Primary Respiratory Acidosis:

- Acute versus chronic

    - Acute respiratory acidosis and hypercarbia will often present with
        somnolence or AMS

    - Similarly, if a PCO2 is 80, and the patient is talking to you, it is
        most likely chronic

- Acute Causes: Decreased respiratory drive (opiates, intoxication),
    respiratory muscle weakness (i.e., myasthenia gravis)

- Chronic Causes: COPD, sleep apnea

Primary Respiratory Alkalosis

- Acute Causes: Mechanical ventilation, anxiety/panic attack, pain, PE

- Chronic Causes: Pregnancy, CNS disorder, hormones (thyroid,
    progesterone)

## Compensation for primary respiratory disorders

|         | Respiratory Acidosis                         | Respiratory alkalosis                      |
|---------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Acute   | 10:1                                         | 10:2                                       |
| Chronic | 10:3.5                                       | 10:4                                       |
|         | For every ↑of 10 in pCO2, HCO3 ↑ by 1 or 3.5 | For every ↓ of 10 in pCO2 HCO3 ↓ by 2 or 4 |

## Primary Metabolic Alkalosis

- Appropriate Respiratory Compensation?

    - Expected pCO2 = 0.7\*(HCO3) + 20 (+/-5)

- Etiologies: Associated with high aldosterone (either appropriate or
    inappropriate)

    - Chloride Responsive = appropriate hyperaldosteronism, can usually be
        fixed with Cl administration/ volume resuscitation

        - Etiologies: Volume contraction i.e., vomiting, over-diuresis)

        - Urine Cl \<20

    - Chloride Unresponsive = inappropriate hyperaldosteronism, cannot fix
        with NaCl administration/ volume resuscitation

        - Etiologies: Steroids, Cushing’s, Conn’s, RAS, CHF, cirrhosis

        - Urine Cl \>20

Primary Metabolic Acidosis: See nephrology section, “Metabolic Acidosis”
