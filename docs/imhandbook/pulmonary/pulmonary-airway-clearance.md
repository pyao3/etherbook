# Airway Clearance Therapy

Patrick Barney

---

## Indications

    - Cystic fibrosis, advanced COPD, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis,
        chronic neuromuscular weakness, prolonged ventilator-dependence

    - Goal is to assist patients with removing/expectorating mucus from
        lungs to decrease risk of atelectasis, mucus plug, increased airway
        resistance, infection

## Chest Physiotherapy (CPT)

    - Use: pathologies w/ retained secretions and mucous plugging (CF,
        bronchiectasis)

    - RT helps patient go through sequence of positions aimed at
        “draining” each of the lobes of the lung by gravity. Sometimes
        combined with percussion.

    - Finding in Epic: chest physiotherapy > CPPD panel – will initiate
        RT bronchial hygiene protocol and order TID CPT

## High Frequency Chest Wall Compression (HFCWC)

    - Use: pathologies w/ retained secretions (CF, bronchiectasis, chronic
        bronchitis) or mucociliary clearance problems (lung transplant)

    - RT wraps patient in inflatable vest, compressor rapidly inflates and
        deflates vest to “break up” thickened mucus from airway wall so it
        can be suctioned or expectorated

    - Finding in Epic: vest > Facility List > vest physiotherapy or vest
        physiotherapy for CF under Procedures

## Positive Expiratory Pressure (PEP)

    - Use: pathologies w/ retained secretions as discussed above

    - Patient exhales against fixed or fluttering resistor that allows air
        to get behind mucus, helps move mucus from airway walls, and holds
        airways open longer for improved ventilation

    - Trade names- Flutter, Acapella, AerobikA

    - Finding in Epic: PEP > Facility List > PEP therapy panel or
        Oscillatory PEP therapy panel under Order Sets

        - Can also find in a supply closet on 8S and bring to patient, be
            sure to teach them how to use it

## Cough Assist

    - Use: most effective in patients with neuromuscular weakness
        affecting diaphragmatic strength – muscular dystrophy, myasthenia
        gravis, spinal cord lesions, SMA

    - Via mask or trach/vent connection – applies positive pressure to
        fill the lungs, then quickly switches to negative pressure to
        produce a high expiratory flow rate to simulate a cough that is
        intended to produce expectorant

    - Finding in Epic: cough assist > Facility List > cough assist
        treatment panel under Order Sets
