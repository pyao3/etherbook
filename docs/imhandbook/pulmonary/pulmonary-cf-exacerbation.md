# Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Exacerbation

## Background

- Presentation: acute worsening of pulmonary symptoms such as
    new/increased cough, sputum production (or change in sputum
    quality), dyspnea. May have constitutional symptoms including
    fatigue, poor appetite

## Evaluation

- “Cystic Fibrosis” Admission order set in epic is useful and contains
    most of the work-up and management listed below

- Labs: Sputum culture (specify CF culture), RPP

- CXR PA and lateral

- Always ask about coughing up blood and amount -- see 'Hemoptysis'
    section if present

## Management

- All patients need a cystic fibrosis pulmonary consult (unless on
    Rogers Pulmonary if attending specializes in CF). FYI there is no
    fellow so don’t worry when you have to page an attending

- All CF pts are placed on contact precautions

- Antibiotics

    - Check CF notes, recent hospitalizations, culture data – MRSA, MSSA,
        and Pseudomonas are the most common

    - If they were recently admitted and improved on that antibiotic
        regimen, it is usually a good empiric choice. CF team will
        ultimately guide regimen

- General coverage:

    - MRSA vancomycin (Bactrim or linezolid for allergies)

- Pseudomonas Penicillin class (cephalosporin, carbapenem, extended
    penicillin) AND aminoglycoside or Ciprofloxacin (double coverage)

- Be aware that the antibiotic doses are not the typical doses used
    for other indications. Use Epic Order Adult Cystic Fibrosis order
    set for Antibiotic/dosing (or consult with CF team, pharmacy)

- Continue tobramycin nebs (if on that month) and MWF Azithromycin
    unless otherwise contraindicated if they are on these therapies at
    home

- Airway/sputum clearance

    - Albuterol nebs, pulmozyme (if on at home), hypertonic saline (if on
        at home), Vest, positive end expiratory pressure valve (PEP, ex:
        Flutter, Acapella), chest percussive devices (the wand) as last
        choice (not as effective)

- CF modulators (e.g., ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elaxacaftor): continue if
    on at home, needs a non-formulary order so pt can use own supply;
    time with fat rich meal for absorption

- Nutrition/GI

    - Pancreatic enzymes (most pts are on them), order at bedside for pt
        administration

    - Always continue ADEK vitamins

    - Daily to 3 times a week weight checks

    - Nutrition consult

## DIOS - Distal Intestinal Obstruction Syndrome

-  Acute obstruction (complete or incomplete) in ileocecum by
    inspissated intestinal contents. Presents with abdominal
    pain/distension, constipation, poor appetite, possibly vomiting
    often looks like mechanical obstruction

- Treat with Miralax and/or Golytely

- RARELY surgery, try medical management first
