## Inhaler therapy

- Current inhaler device delivery options

    - MDI – typical handheld inhaler

        - Pro is same dose of medicine each time you use them – if used
            correctly.

        - Con is that it requires coordination. Patient must be able to
            time 3-5s slow inhalation and 5-10s breath hold w/ release of
            medicine, can be helped w/ spacer.

    - SMI – “soft mist inhaler,” handheld. Creates cloud of medicine that
        is inhaled without propellant.

        - Pros are more medicine gets into lungs than w/ MDI so lower dose
            can be used, does not require coordination.

    - DPI - handheld inhaler, delivers medicine whenever patient breathes
        in through the device, requiring less coordination.

        - Pro is lack of need to coordinate breath; Con is inconsistent
            dose delivery.

- Nebulizers

    - Saline

        - Hypertonic saline, NS, 3% and 7%. Can be used to thin secretions
            and produce deep cough in patients who need to expectorate as
            part of treatment. For CF, chronic tracheostomy, NM weakness. No
            evidence for benefit in COPD.

    - Enzymatic Agents

        - Dornase alpha – Pulmozyme – “DNAse’ - enzyme that breaks down
            polymerized DNA in high concentrations in CF airways, indicated
            specifically for patients with CF

    - Anticholinergics

        - COPD exacerbation, asthma exacerbation – bronchodilation and
            secretion inhibition in acute setting

        - Ipratropium (Atrovent) intermittent nebulizer or
            Ipratropium-albuterol (Duo-Neb) intermittent or continuous
            nebulizer

    - Disulfide Disrupters

        - Sever disulfide bonds of glycoproteins in mucus, lowering its
            viscosity and making it more amenable to suction, expectoration

        - N-acetylcysteine (Mucomyst) - nebulized form available in “adult
            burn inhalation injury protocol” when search “mucomyst”

- Antibiotics

    - May be indicated in patients w/ CF, non-CF bronchiectasis, VAP
        as salvage therapy

    - Tobramycin – only nebulized antibiotic available at VUMC

## Categories of inhaled medications

- Short-acting beta agonist (SABA): beta-2 agonism of bronchial smooth
    muscle to achieve bronchodilation; also decrease mast cell mediator
    release. Ex: albuterol, levalbuterol

- Long-acting beta agonist (LABA): - beta-2 agonists, same as SABAs
    but have lipophilic side chains that allow longer binding but also
    slow the onset of action. Ex: formoterol, salmeterol, olodaterol

- Long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA): - non-specific muscarinic
    receptor antagonists, leads to bronchodilation and reduced
    secretions. Ex: tiotropium, umeclidinium, glycopyrrolate

- Inahled corticosteroid (ICS): - suppress airway inflammation. Ex:
    budesonide, fluticasone, mometasone

## VUMC Inpatient Options

- SABA : Albuterol (Proventil/Ventolin/Proair) - MDI, neb, continuous
    aerosol available

- SABA/SAMA: Ipratropium-albuterol (Duo-Neb) - neb and continuous neb
    available

- LABA – only available in combination w/ ICS. LABA/ICS:
    vilanterol-fluticasone (Breo Ellipta), salmeterol-fluticasone
    (Advair Diskus/HFA)

- LAMA: Tiotropium (Spiriva Respimat)

- ICS: Budesonide inhaler (Pulmicort) or neb, fluticasone furoate
    (Arnuity Ellipta)
