# Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs)

## Full PFTs include:

- Spirometry: FVC, FEV1, with or without bronchodilator

    - Patients with new shortness of breath, chronic cough, or upper
        airway obstruction

- Plethysmography: TLC, RV

    - Evaluation of restrictive diseases (ILD, neuromuscular) or
        hyperinflation (COPD, asthma)

- Diffusion (DLCO) can be added to plethysmography

- 'Full PFTs' = Spirometry + Plethysmography + DLCO

## Tips for ordering:

- Initial diagnostic workup: Full PFTs with bronchodilator challenge

- Chronic Lung disease: Spirometry to track FEV1/FVC over time +/-
    DLCO to evaluate ILD

## Interpretation:

- Distinguish between obstructive and restrictive disease

    - FEV1/FVC \< 0.7 indicates obstructive disease

        - Normal to increased FVC & TLC is consistent with isolated
            obstructive disease

    - TLC \< 80% is diagnostic of restrictive disease

        - Reduced FVC is suggestive, but not diagnostic of restrictive
            disease

        - FEV1 commonly too but FEV1/FVC ratio is normal in isolated
            restrictive disease

    - Decreased FEV1/FVC and TLC suggests a mixed obstructive and
        restrictive picture

- Assess DLCO -- abnormal is \<75%

    - Decreased DLCO can help differentiate between causes of obstructive
        or restrictive PFTs

## Causes of common abnormalities:

- Obstruction

    - Decreased DLCO: COPD, CF, bronchiectasis

    - Normal DLCO: asthma, early stages of COPD or CF

        - Asthma: spirometry may be normal, +bronchodilator response (an
            increase in FEV1 by 12% and 200ml after bronchodilator),
            +methacholine challenge

    - Though we use FEV1/FVC to diagnose, we track disease severity using
        FEV1

- Restriction:

    - Decreased DLCO: ILD

    - Normal DLCO: pleural disease, chest wall (obesity, scoliosis),
        neuromuscular disorders

- Decreased DLCO: If PFTs otherwise normal consider pulmonary vascular
    disease, pulmonary edema, or mixed obstructive/restrictive disease
    (pseudo-normalization of PFTs)
