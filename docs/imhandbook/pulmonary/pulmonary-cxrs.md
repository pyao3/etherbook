| How to Interpret Chest Radiographs (CXR) – Gautam Babu |

An X-ray is a density-gram where “white” is “dense” and “black” is “not
dense”.  Determine a systematic method you use every time you interpret
a CXR to ensure you don’t miss anything.

-   Start every CXR you interpret by assessing the quality of the film:
    -   Penetration: You should be able to see vertebral bodies through
        the cardiac silhouette but not into the abdomen. If you cannot
        see them through the heart the film is “under-penetrated” and
        everything will appear more “white.” If you can see them through
        the abdomen the film is “over-penetrated” and everything will
        appear more “black”
    -   Rotation: The spinous processes should be in the middle of the
        clavicular heads, if not then the film is rotated

-   Two Different Systematic Methods:
    -   ABCDE method
        -   Airway – Trachea midline and patent
        -   Bones – Bone density and obvious fractures
        -   Cardiac Silhouette – You should be able to see the L and R
            heart border, if not there may be an adjacent opacity (Right
            Middle Lobe, Lingula)
        -   Cardiomegaly defined as heart size
            ≥
            1/2 width of the hemithorax *on a PA film*
        -   Diaphragm – Look for pleural effusions at the costo-phrenic
            angle. If you cannot see the diaphragm along the way there
            may be an adjacent opacity (Lower Lobe)
        -   “Everything else” – Refers to the lung fields but if you
            wanted to continue the alphabet mnemonic
        -   Extra-Thoracic Soft Tissue – Subcutaneous emphysema
        -   Fields and Fissures –lung fields should appear symmetric and
            “black.” Asymmetry suggests there is an issue on one side.
        -   Great Vessels – Tortuosity of the aorta and the outlines of
            the pulmonary vessels
        -   Hilum – Hilar masses, LAD and pulmonary arteries, the left
            hila is higher than the right normally because of the heart

-   Working around the film method:
    -   Imagine the entire CXR film as a square and an inner “box” as
        the pleural lining

-   -   Outside the box: Looking for lines, tubes, EKG/tele leads,
        subcutaneous emphysema, stomach bubble, sub diaphragmatic air
    -   The edge of the box: Looking for pleural thickening, pleural
        effusion, pneumothorax, visualization of the diaphragm
    -   The middle of the box: aka Mediastinum -> trachea, vascular
        pedicle, hila, heart borders, great vessels, retrocardiac space
    -   The lung fields

One important concept to know is the **silhouette sign:** Two things of
different densities will show a clear border on a chest x-ray. In the
contrapositive, the loss of a border you expect to see suggests there
has been

a change in density of one of the structures. For example, the heart and
the lung are different densities and as such you have a sharp border.
Loss of this border suggests that the adjacent lung “increased” in
density from a PNA (in the right clinical scenario).

-   Often try to distinguish PNA from pulmonary edema, as these are two
    of the most common causes of abnormal opacities seen on CXR
    -   PNA
        -   "fluffy" opacities and air bronchograms frequently indicate
            alveolar filling
        -   typically asymmetric
    -   Pulmonary Edema
        -   linear opacities, fluid in the fissure, Kerley B lines,
            cephalization, bilateral pleural effusions
        -   Typically symmetric
        -   atypical or viral PNA can similarly present with linear
            opacities
