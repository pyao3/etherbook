# COPD Exacerbation 

Taylor Coston

---

## Background

- Presentation: increased dyspnea, cough, and sputum production or
    purulence, diffuse wheezing, distant breath sounds, tachypnea,
    tachycardia

- Severe respiratory insufficiency: accessory muscle use, fragmented
    speech, inability to lie supine, profound diaphoresis, agitation,
    asynchrony between chest and abdominal wall with respiration,
    failure to improve with initial emergency treatment

- Impending respiratory arrest: Inability to maintain respiratory
    effort, cyanosis, hemodynamic instability, and depressed mental
    status

- Remember that patients with COPD can have other causes of
    respiratory distress including acute coronary syndrome,
    decompensated heart failure, PE, PNA, PTX, sepsis, acidosis

##Evaluation

- Initial Assessment: ABCs

    - Airway/Breathing: Ensure patient is protecting airway

        - If obtunded or in severe respiratory distress intubation

        - BiPAP typically appropriate for severe COPD exacerbation unless
            contraindication (vomiting, obtundation, facial trauma)

            - BiPAP is ordered as IPAP and EPAP, 12/5 is often a good
                start

    - Circulation

        - For hemodynamic instability immediate rapid sequence intubation.
            Pt’s can be hypotensive for a host of reasons (pneumothorax,
            sepsis, circulatory collapse from hypoxia and bradycardia, etc)

- Subsequent Workup:

    - Continuous pulse oximetry, ABG/VBG, EKG, CXR, CBC, BMP, troponin,
        BNP, sputum cx, RPP, blood cultures if hemodynamically unstable

    - Lung ultrasound to differentiate COPD from pulmonary edema when a pt
        presents with wheezing and respiratory failure (pulmonary edema will
        have B lines)

    - Consider trigger: viral infection (70%), PNA, PE (have a high index
        of suspicion for PE)

## Management

- Bronchodilators

    - Order “Respiratory Care Therapy Management Protocol” at VUMC

        - RT evaluates the pt and based on physical exam will give a
            duoneb. Continues to assess the pt and treats based on severity
            of the exacerbation

    - If ordering bronchodilators individually:

        - Albuterol 2.5 mg diluted to 3 mL via nebulizer or 4 to 8
            inhalations from MDI every 4 hours while awake (RT) or more
            frequently if needed

        - Ipratropium 500 mcg via nebulizer, or 4-8 inhalations from MDI
            q4 hrs while awake

        - Can additionally order Duoneb (albuterol and ipratroprium) q4-6
            hours at VUMC

        - There is no respiratory order protocol at the VA, order
            individually as above
            
- Steroids

    - For severe exacerbation give methylprednisolone 125 mg IV BID (or
        60mg IV q6h)

    - For moderate to mild COPD exacerbations give prednisone 40mg PO
        daily for 5 days (including the initial IV dose if pt received one
        in the ER)


- Antibiotics

    - For moderate to severe exacerbations

    - Azithromycin (500mg x 1 then 250mg daily x 4 or 500mg daily x 3) or
        doxycycline 200 mg BID if concern for QT prolongation. Can consider
        respiratory fluroquinolone in certain high-risk patients but
        typically too broad

    - Refer to Pneumonia in Infection Disease chapter if treating
        concomitant pneumonia

- Discharge Planning:

    - Controller medications/inhalers (see COPD in Outpatient chapter)

        - Make sure any new inhalers are covered by insurance prior to
            discharge

        - Provide inhaler education and consider use of a spacer

    - Vaccinations (influenza, COVID, pneumococcal)
