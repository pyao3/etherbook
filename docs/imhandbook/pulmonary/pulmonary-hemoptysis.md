# Hemoptysis 

Henry Brems

---

## Background

- Distinguish between massive (\>600cc/24hr or \>100cc/hr) and
    non-massive hemoptysis. Can be difficult to quantify expectorated
    blood volume and volume that is retained in lungs

- Massive is potentially life-threatening due to impaired ventilation

- Remember UGIB (hematemesis) and nasopharyngeal bleeds can easily
    mimic hemoptysis

- Presentation based on source of bleed:

## Evaluation

- Check for anticoagulation on med list

- Labs: CBC, BMP, Coags, UA (for hematuria), ABG (evaluate
    oxygenation), type and screen

    - Consider ANA, ANCA, Anti-GBM, sputum culture (bacteria, fungal,
        AFB), sputum cytology depending on clinical context

- Imaging: CXR first (to evaluate etiology and to localize the source
    to a side). Chest CT depending on prior workup, severity of bleed,
    and stability of patient

- Bronchoscopy is sometimes indicated to localize bleeding source

## Management

- Urgent evaluation if any hemodynamic compromise, hypoxia,
    hypercarbia, or respiratory distress

- Ensure a secure airway: massive hemoptysis may require intubation
    and MICU transfer

- Reverse underlying coagulopathy if present. Consider trending HCT

- If unilateral bleed, place bleeding lung down (i.e. if the source is
    left lung, place pt on left side) to prevent filling 'good' lung
    with blood (include this info in sign-out if known)

- Urgent pulmonary consult if clinical instability: Bronchoscopy is
    diagnostic and therapeutic

- Obtain CT Bronchial Artery Protocol if concern for bronchial artery
    source (especially in CF patients) so embolization can be planned
    
    - Order this at VUMC with a CTA Chest (NOT a CTA PE as that will be
        timed incorrectly) and include "bronchial artery protocol" in
        comments for the study

- Consider IR consult for angiography as diagnostic and therapeutic
        option

    - Consult early if there is massive hemoptysis; If bronchoscopy is
        attempted but fails to stop the bleed, they can get to angiography
        fastest if IR has already been made aware
