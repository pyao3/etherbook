# Hypoxia 

Henry Brems

---

## Background

- Two major ways to measure oxygenation, which are similar but
    distinct:

- SpO2 or "pulse ox" - most common, measures the O2 saturation of Hgb
    at capillary level

    - \<95% is abnormal, but do not need supplemental O2 unless
        \<90-92% in most pts

- PaO2 - the partial pressure of oxygenation measured on an ABG

    - \<80 mmHg is abnormal

- The relationship between SpO2 and PaO2 is the classic S-shaped
    curve.

    - SpO2 of \<88% PaO2 begins to fall off dangerously fast

## Evaluation

- Confirm true hypoxia with good pleth

- CXR

- Labs: CBC, BMP, BNP, troponin, ABG/VBG

- EKG

- TTE: obtain with bubble if shunt on ddx

- Lung US: B lines, lung sliding, effusions, consolidations
    (hepatization), diaphragm paralysis

- Chest CT without contrast for evaluation of lung parenchyma

- CTA chest if suspicion for PE (see PE section)

- Outpatient PFTs if suspected obstructive or restrictive disease

## Management

- Should be directed at underlying cause

- If acutely decompensating, Duonebs, IV lasix, antibiotics depending
    on clinical picture

- Supplemental O2 for goal SpO2:

    - \>90-92% for most patients (There is generally no need to make SpO2
        100%)

    - Between 88-92% for patients with chronic hypoxia from COPD (i.e., on
        home O2)
