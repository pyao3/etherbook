# Interstitial Lung Disease

## Background

- Heterogenous group of parenchymal lung diseases that involve
    scarring or fibrosis, affecting the lung interstitium, alveoli, and
    pulmonary capillaries

    - Leads to loss of lung volume and compliance and impaired gas
        exchange

## Etiologies

- ILD is divided into primary (idiopathic) causes and secondary causes

- Idiopathic: idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, eosinophilic pneumonia,
    idiopathic NSIP, organizing pneumonia, acute interstitial pneumonia,
    etc

- Secondary

    - Systemic:

        - Connective tissue disease: RA, Sjogrens, dermatomyositis,
            polymyositis SLE, MCTD, scleroderma

        - Granulomatous disease: sarcoidosis, TB

        - Vasculitis: granulomatosis with polyangiitis, eosinophilic
            granulomatosis with polyangiitis, amyloidosis,
            lymphangioleiomyomatosis

    - Exposure

        - Pneumoconiosis (inorganic) – exposure to coal mines, silica,
            asbestos, organic solvents, heavy metals, solder, hair dressing
            chemicals

        - Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (organic)- farm exposures, chicken
            coops, pesticide, stored grains, mold (ex: water damage in home,
            hot tubs)

        - Iatrogenic – amiodarone, immunotherapies, TKI, TNF-a inhibitors,
            nitrofurantoin, radiation

## Evaluation

- Dry cough is the most common symptom of ILD. Productive coughs are
    uncharacteristic

- History:

    - Duration, timing, severity of respiratory symptoms

    - Exposures – pets, occupation, residence, smoking, drugs, travel,
        hobbies, dust, hay, grass,

    - Screen for autoimmune symptoms (arthritis, myalgia, rash, Raynaud’s
        phenomenon

    - Screen for vasculitis symptoms: hematuria, hemoptysis, mononeuritis
        multiplex

    - Medication history

    - Family history – premature aging, myelodysplastic syndrome (most
        common familial IPF association with telomerase mutations)


- Chest Imaging:

    - CXR – could find peripheral reticular opacities

    - HRCT protocol is used for diagnosis: evaluates the lung parenchyma
        while pt is supine, prone, with inspiratory and expiratory cuts

    - There are two morphologic features on HRCT

        - Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP): basilar predominant
            fibrosis, honey combing, and traction bronchiectasis. Minimal
            GGOs. Pattern seen in IPF.

        - Non-Specific Interstitial Pneumonia (NSIP): Marked by subpleural
            sparing, increased reticular patterns, and mosaic attenuation
            due to air trapping. Minimal or absent honeycombing

## Labs

- Rule out infection: CBC, RPP, sputum Cx, Histo antigen, Blasto antigen, Aspergillus galactomannan, 1,3-β-D-Glucan, sputum GMS, consider NTM, HIV

 - Rheumatologic workup: ANA w/ reflex ENA, ESR, CRP, CK, aldolase,
            consider full myositis panel, RF, anti-CCP

## Bronchoscopy

- BAL is not diagnostic ILD (except eosinophilic PNA), may be helpful
        to rule out infection

- Transbronchial biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis. Surgical
        lung biopsy may be helpful in cases where the clinical evaluation
        and imaging are not effective (uncommon)

## Misc:

 - PFTs with 6-minute walk test (prognostic value)

 - TTE to evaluate for pHTN

 - SLP evaluation for indolent aspiration

## Management

- Acute flare – all non- UIP = may respond to steroids. Consult
    rheumatology if CTD origin for further options.

- Chronic therapy

    - Consider tyrosine kinase inhibitor (nintedanib; INPULSIS trial) and
        antifibrotics (pirfenidone; ASCEND trial) – reduces FVC decline but
        no change in mortality

    - There is increased mortality in IPF with azathioprine/pred/NAC
        (PANTHER-IPF); steroids are not indicated

    - Immunosuppression for autoimmune related ILD

    - Antigen avoidance for hypersensitivity pneumonitis

- Consider lung transplant evaluation for severe disease
