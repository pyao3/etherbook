## Background

- Needs to meet two or more of following criteria:
    - Insufficient calorie intake
    - Weight loss
    - Loss of muscle mass
    - Loss of subcutaneous fat
    - Localized fluid accumulation that may mask weight loss
    - Diminished functional status as measured in handgrip strength
- Reversible causes of malnutrition:
    - Food security (poverty), dental status (dentition, gum health),
    dietary restrictions, food-related functional status (shop, prepare
    meals, feed self), depression, dementia, alcoholism, swallowing
    ability

## Evaluation

- Assess for depression
- Screening with Mini Nutritional Assessment (good sensitivity and
    specificity)
- Order: CBC, CMP, TSH
- Nutritional deficiencies: B12, folate, vitamin D
- Consider CT C/A/P depending on history
- Refeeding: K, Phos, Mg BID until stable and no longer having to
    replete

## Management

- Manage reversible causes of malnutrition as above
- Medications: consider Remeron (7.5 mg nightly). Avoid Megace (NNH =
    23 for death)
- Liberalize dietary restrictions
- Nutritional Supplementation: Oral enteral supplements (i.e.
    nutritional shakes)
