# Falls

## Background

- Screen annually for falls in the past year
- History of fall is a strong risk factor for future falls
- Recommended History Screening Tool: CDC STEADI Algorithm
- Physical Exam Screening Tools:
- If potentially unstable injuries (new spine fracture or lower
    extremity fracture): Ask ortho to clear the patient for mobility
- If no potentially unstable injuries, attempt to get the patient out
    of bed
    - If lying down, have them lift each leg off the bed
    - If they can do this, ask them to sit up on side of bed
    - If they can do this, ask them to stand
    - If they can do this without assistance, then observe them walk
- The Timed “up and Go” Test (TUG) tool for fall risk
    - Have the patient rise from sitting in a chair, walk 10 feet
        forward, turn around, walk back to chair, and sit down
    - Patients who require > 10 seconds are at increased risk for
        falls
- Med Rec:
    - Antipsychotics, antidepressants, anticholinergics, anxiolytics,
    sedatives/hypnotics, anti-hypertensives, antiarrhythmics, steroids,
    statins all can increase risk of falls

## Management

- Rule out other causes: Cardiac, Neurologic, Infectious
- Check Vitamin D levels (goal \> 30) and supplement (800-1000 IU
    daily) if at increased fall risk
- Assess visual acuity (e.g. expedite cataract surgery)
- Hearing assessment (audiology screen)
- Consult Inpatient PT/OT and refer for HH PT/OT for home safety
    evaluation at discharge
- Recommend non-skid shoes with a backing (sneaker)
- Modify extrinsic risk factors for falls: removal of fall hazards,
    placement of handrails
- Referral to Exercise programs: At VUMC = Dayani Center “Ambulatory
    Referral to Medical Fitness” outpatient order
