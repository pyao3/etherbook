## 4 M’s of Age-Friendly Care

Endorsed by the IHI to provide best evidence-based care to older
patients across all settings of care:

- What **M**atters Most: Understand each patients specific healthcare
    goals in the short and long term. Ask “what matters most” and align
    the care plan with what matters.
- **M**edication: Aim to reduce adverse drug events in the elderly by
    thorough med rec and avoiding potentially inappropriate medications
    (e.g. Beers Criteria) when possible
- **M**entation: Identify, treat, and manage dementia, depression, and
    delirium across various settings of care.
- **M**obility: Assess and optimize mobility

## Physiological Changes with Aging

- **Cardiovascular**: Decreased vascular compliance and increased
    stiffness (intimal thickening). Decreased cardiac output. Maximum
    achievable HR decreases. Increase in systolic BP with decrease in
    diastolic BP (wider PP).
- **Endocrine/Immune:** Impairment of glucose tolerance (insulin
    resistance). Decreased sympathetic response to stress. Impairment of
    T-cell immunity and increased susceptibility to infection.
- **Gastrointestinal:** Decreased GI absorption, gastric emptying,
    motility, acid secretion, and hepatic blood flow. Reduced appetite
    and alterations of taste and smell.
- **Musculoskeletal:** Decreased bone density, muscle mass and
    strength. Increased fracture risk.
- **Neurologic:** Reduced cortical volume. Blunted vision, auditory
    function, and vibrotactile sensation. Decreased autonomic neural
    response. Slowed cognition and reflexes.
- **Pulmonary:** Increased chest wall rigidity. Decreased respiratory
    muscle strength. Decreased FEV1; FVC. Diminished ventilatory
    response to hypercapnia and hypoxia.
- **Renal:** Increased glomerulosclerosis. Decreased GFR and renal
    clearance of drugs/metabolites (↓ 1mL/min per year after age 40; Cr
    may stay the same due to reduced muscle mass). Reduced tubular
    function.
