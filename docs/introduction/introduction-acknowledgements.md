# Acknowledgements and Rationale

Kijabe Anesthesia Handbook was created as a tool to facilitate delivery of high 
quality anesthesia care in a resource limited setting using the available tools 
(a mobile phone and the internet). We hope to provide readers with direct
and actionable guidance, consolidating the combined wisdom of
generations of residents, KRNAs, and faculty experts.

Purpose of this document is:
- KRNA students: teach the basics of clinical anesthesia 
- Visiting residents/fellows: orient to anesthesia in Kijabe
- Seasoned anesthesia providers: refresh on rare or emergent cases

We would like to thank Dr. Beau Hilton for his help establishing this handbook.
